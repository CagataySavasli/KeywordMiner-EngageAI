Executive Summary

The 2024 elections resulted in a significant shift in federal leadership, with key implications for county governments across the United States. The 2024 election cycle follows a recent pattern of change, with 11 out of the past 13 elections (exceptions in 2004 and 2012) resulting in a shift in control of the White House, House or Senate.

Counties play a vital role in the administration and oversight of elections across the country. This includes management and coordination of voter registration, poll workers, polling places, and the casting and tallying of votes. During each election cycle, counties oversee over 100,000 polling places and manage over 630,000 poll workers. Thank you to county government officials and volunteers for playing a crucial role in upholding our democratic system.

Presidential Election

President-elect Donald Trump has been declared the unofficial winner of the 2024 presidential election. More than 90 percent of counties shifted in favor of President-elect Trump in the 2024 presidential election, according to a preliminary analysis by the New York Times, improving his vote margin from 2020 in more than 2,300 counties. President-elect Donald Trump and Vice-President elect J.D. Vance will assume their respective roles on January 21, 2025.

Congress

U.S. Senate Republicans have taken majority control with 53 seats in the Senate, flipping four seats, with key pickups in Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Democrats retained contentious seats in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin and Arizona. Republicans retained narrow control of the House, having met the 218-seat threshold needed for chamber control. This solidifies a Republican trifecta with control over the Presidency, House and Senate.

Governorships

There were eleven governors seats up for election in 2024. All three incumbents, Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), Spencer Cox (R- Utah), and Phil Scott (R-Vt.) retained office. No governor seats were flipped, maintaining the GOP control of 27 seats to the Democrats’ 23.

State Legislatures

Eighty-five of the country's 99 state legislative chambers held regularly scheduled elections in 2024, representing 5,807 of the country's 7,386 state legislative seats (79 percent). The GOP made slight gains in control of state legislatures, flipping the Michigan House and attaining a tie in the Minnesota House. Democrats lost “trifecta” control, or control of both state chambers and the governorship, in two states. There are now 38 trifectas across the U.S., down from 40.

"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost - The Guardian,"It has been an extraordinary week for US politics – and a very depressing couple of days for those such as me who spent hours on the phone to people, trying to persuade them to vote for Kamala Harris and not Donald Trump. This is what voters told me time and again, and why so many did vote for Trump.

The first type of voter I encountered as a volunteer on the Harris phone bank was the one focused purely on the economy. It is hard for people on the European side of the Atlantic to grasp that soaring growth rates and low unemployment in the US would not be seen positively in the eyes of an American voter. But it was clear in my conversations that the Trump campaign was extremely effective at countering that story. Wages may well be rising at all levels, but everyday inflation was more discernible to voters.

Very often, I spoke to small business owners who would talk about the price of gas or bread, rendering any attempted explanation of global pressures responsible for that ineffective at best, and at worst condescending. Often, they would also tell me that everyone they knew was doing badly, even if they were just fine themselves. Was poor messaging to blame? That didn’t seem obvious. Democrats tried to tell the story of average wages being higher and unemployment being at an historic low, but people just seemed to believe Trump more often than they believed Harris and Tim Walz. There was no easy way to counter that, especially in a campaign lasting barely 100 days.

The next group was extremely focused on Harris as a candidate. She was as baggage-free as a vice-president could have been, and many voters spoke of how much they admired her. But there were too many others. Multiple times, I was told that Harris was a “communist”, “clueless” and that she had “thrown black men in jail for carrying one blunt”. One Latin American voter told me at length that she had “seen it all before in South America”.

Harris’s perceived failures on border security did come up too, but mainly the criticisms came straight from the mouth of the Trump campaign. Some spoke of Harris’s tough stance on crime as the district attorney of San Francisco. Others, very often of Latino origin, would tell me that she was soft on law and order. Quite remarkably, the Trump campaign successfully branded Harris as both a communist – lax on law and order – and simultaneously too tough on crime. To many, she was both an ineffective vice-president and one who had her hands all over the Biden administration. Voters held these facts in their heads at once – and would not be persuaded otherwise.

I started calling voters five weeks ago and especially then, many voters said they didn’t know who Harris was or what she stood for. It is said that an open primary process would have given Harris the chance to separate herself from Biden, but not a single person I spoke to suggested that they would have preferred a different candidate.

But gender did play a role. Time and again, voters, very often women themselves, told me that they just didn’t think that “America is ready for a female president”. People said they couldn’t “see her in the chair” and asked if I “really thought a woman could run the country”. One person memorably told me that she couldn’t vote for Harris because “you don’t see women building skyscrapers”. Sometimes, these people would be persuaded, but more often than not it was a red line. Many conversations would start with positive discussions on policy and then end on Harris and her gender. That is an extraordinary and uncomfortable truth.

You should know what I didn’t hear during the hours speaking to US voters. I can only think of one occasion when someone mentioned stricter taxes on billionaires or any similar policies. The atrocities being committed by Israel in Gaza only came up six times in more than 1,000 calls. The idea that Harris was not leftwing enough seems false: the majority of the country just voted for the complete opposite.

After all those conversations, I think the main reason that Harris and Walz lost this campaign is simple: Trump. Ultimately, he was simply too much of a pull again. Despite the gaffes, despite his views on women, despite his distaste for democracy and despite an insurrection, voters just didn’t care.

For reasons that I’m sure will be studied for decades, when he speaks, people listen. When he speaks, people believe him. After all those calls, I can be shocked at this result, but hardly surprised.",I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,"US elections showed resilience of democratic institutions with a well-run process in a highly polarized campaign, international observers say - OSCE","WASHINGTON D.C., 6 November 2024 – Engagement was high across the political spectrum in yesterday’s US elections that underscored the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions. The presidential vote was highly competitive, but the campaign was marked by deep polarization and harsh and confrontational rhetoric, while public trust was undermined by disinformation campaigns and political violence, international observers said in a statement today.

The joint observation mission from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) found that while the constitution and a number of federal laws provide a broad and sound framework for holding elections in line with democratic standards, the legal framework has remained mostly unchanged at the federal level since the last elections, leaving most previous ODIHR recommendations unaddressed.

“These elections were a demonstration of the resilience of America’s democratic institutions, as public engagement overcame repeated unfounded claims of elections fraud and divisive rhetoric,” said Pia Kauma, Special Co-ordinator and leader of the OSCE short-term observers. “Especially in this contentious campaign environment, our observations serve to provide a full picture of the situation.”

The elections were organized efficiently and professionally, but threats, harassment, and violence against election administrators were a cause for serious concern and made recruiting election workers a challenge, as well as making additional security measures necessary. Voting technologies were used extensively for voter registration, ballot casting, and vote counting. While a range of useful tools and training were developed to strengthen election safety, concerns about security and assertions from both foreign and domestic sources that sought to sow doubt and delegitimize the electoral process continued to damage public trust.

An estimated 244 million voters were eligible to vote in these elections. Voter ID remained a controversial issue, with supporters claiming the laws safeguard election integrity and opponents arguing they disproportionately affect various minority groups. Certain segments of the U.S. population remain disenfranchised, despite prior ODIHR recommendations. Election day itself was managed professionally in the polling stations visited by observers, with technical problems such as ballot-scanning errors or voter ID mismatches dealt with promptly.

“Disinformation, threats and even cases of political violence have put this country through a stress test, but these elections showed that the democratic processes in the US remain in good health,” said OSCE PA Head of Delegation Pere Joan Pons. “With campaign spending at record high levels in what appears to be continuous ‘campaign inflation’, systems that enable independent groups to circumvent campaign finance regulations must be amended to avoid inequalities.”

While campaign finance is regulated by federal laws and court rulings that contain detailed regulations on the funding of candidates, the campaigns for this year’s election were marked by record high spending, increasing concerns over unregulated financial contributions and disproportionate advantage for candidates with extensive funding.

Civil and political rights were respected throughout the campaign, but it unfolded in a highly polarized environment amidst personal attacks and incidents of election violence including assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump, as well as mutual accusations between the top-running candidates. Repeated claims by Mr. Trump of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 elections, as well as his refusal to pledge to accept the outcome of this election, fuelled doubts about a peaceful post-election transition.

“The nuts and bolts of the American electoral process are strong and stable, despite deep mistrust among the general public,” said Tamás Meszerics, who headed the ODIHR election observation mission. “But the sharp polarisation we are seeing across the country, reinforced by the echo chambers that many people are locked into also through the partisan media, are a worrying trend that could seriously damage democracy in the long term.”

Freedom of expression was respected throughout the campaign, and the extensive media coverage provided voters with a basis to make an informed choice on election day. However, the majority of media outlets tailored their coverage to partisan audiences, amplifying political messaging and contributing to political polarization. While there is strong legal protection for media freedom, observers regrettably noted increasing cases of intimidation and harassment targeting journalists.

A large number of lawsuits were filed against new electoral legislation and implementing regulations. Courts enjoyed trust in adjudicating these appeals, although observers heard a high expectation for widespread post-election litigation and further appeals on cases currently under review. There is a legal prohibition of international election observation in 17 states, against the commitments made by all 57 states of the OSCE. At the same time, it was positive to note that partisan and non-partisan observers were present on election day in great numbers, making the process more transparent.

The international election observation is a joint mission of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA). The observation mission totalled 249 observers from 45 countries, made up of 85 ODIHR-deployed experts and long-term observers, and 164 parliamentarians and staff from the OSCE PA.","US elections showed resilience of democratic institutions with a well-run process in a highly polarized campaign, international observers say  OSCE",OSCE,https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/580111

Which are the various elements –beyond the election itself on 5 November– that need to be taken into account for a new White House Administration to get under way.

Summary

There are only a few days to go before a decisive election is held in the US; but the electoral cycle goes beyond 5 November. The primary stage, which enables the presidential and their vice-presidential candidates to be chosen, ended at the start of summer and culminated in the Republican and Democrat conventions in July and August respectively. Now two more phases draw to a close: the electoral campaign, which culminates on 5 November, centred on the so-called swing statesand attention focused on elections to the Senate and House of Representatives; and the transition period, when the votes are counted and certified, and the transfer of powers takes place. This will conclude on 20 January with the inauguration of the new occupant of the White House, as stipulated in the 20th amendment to the US Constitution.

Analysis

1. The campaign

The electoral campaign in the US formally began on 3 September 2024, one day after the Labor Dayholiday. But the reality is that the starting pistol was fired when Donald Trump announced his intention to run in the Republican primaries. Now there are only a few weeks remaining a closely contested campaign, with an unexpected new Democrat candidate. Since entering the race at the end of July, Vice-president Harris has been able to improve the position of President Biden in the polls both nationally and in the battleground states. Harris has managed to control the terms of the debate and Trump’s campaign has failed in its attempts to link it to a still unpopular President. But although Harris is gaining ground, Trump is not losing support.

Not everything is decided on 5 November. Voting has already begun in some states, with Alabama the first to send out its postal votes on 11 September, followed by another nine that started to do so 45 days prior to the elections. These were gradually joined by the remaining states (voting papers for the armed forces and residents abroad were also sent out 45 days prior to polling day). Voting in person also began five weeks before polling day, with Virginia the first state to begin in-person voting, followed by South Dakota and Minnesota.

In the US it is necessary to register in order to vote, making voting a two-step process that sometimes has the effect of disincentivising the electorate. Formerly, the complicated voting procedures each of the states established, together with a range of other restrictive measures, erected a set of obstacles between voters and ballot boxes, too frequently designed to impede the participation of certain groups of citizens, often identifiable by their ethnicity, race, class, literacy rates or party allegiances. The registration processes have changed considerably and are less openly discriminatory, extending the deadlines and making the process almost automatic, but they continue to impede some citizens’ participation. This is one of the reasons why the turnout in presidential elections has generally been very low, typically hovering around the 50% mark. The 2020 election, however, had the highest turnout of a national election since 1900, with 66% of the population taking part. A new Democrat candidate could once again drive turnout in a tight race and it is expected to match the percentage of previous elections.

The end goal of the two major parties is to amass 270 electors, a simple majority of the Electoral College comprising 538 members.

The Electoral College is a venerable and arcane institution –and by extension, process– which is used only for presidential elections (the popular vote is used to decide all Congressional, state and local elections). This model emerged for the first time in the constitution of 1787. At that time, the idea of using the popular vote to choose the President was explicitly rejected because the founding fathers did not trust voters’ ability to make a wise choice. The Electoral College was thus agreed as a compromise between those who thought that Congress should choose the President and others who advocated a direct popular nationwide vote. In its place, state legislatures were charged with appointing electors to form the Electoral College.

The electors are therefore a group of intermediaries appointed by the US Constitution to choose the country’s President and Vice-president, and they usually hold an elected office or are significant members of a party. Each of the 50 states is assigned a number of Electoral College members to match its total number of representatives in the Lower House plus its senators. Ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961 enabled citizens of the District of Columbia to take part in presidential elections too, since when they have had three electors. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia use a system in which the winner of the popular vote in each of the state elections wins all the electors who have been assigned to the said state. Maine and Nebraska have adopted a different approach. These states assign two electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in the state and then one electoral college vote to the winner of the popular vote in each Congressional district (two in Maine, three in Nebraska). The US Constitution created the Electoral College, but did not explain how the votes would be assigned to the presidential candidates, an ambiguity that allowed these two states this exception.

By casting their vote on the election day or beforehand, voters play their role in the formal process of ‘selecting’ the electors in their state. In most presidential elections in the course of history, the Electoral College has operated without any problem. On five occasions however the winner of the Electoral College has not been the winner of the popular vote. Three of these occurred in the 19th century, none in the 20th century and two in the 21st century. The main problem is that having a President who loses the popular vote despite having won the Electoral College undermines his electoral legitimacy. In 2000 Vice-president Al Gore won the popular vote against Governor George W. Bush by slightly more than 500,000 votes. In 2016 the results were even more dramatic, with Clinton winning the popular vote by more than 2,800,000 and losing the Electoral College. In the 2020 presidential election, a switch of only 45,000 votes in three states –Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona– could have created a tie in the Electoral College and forced a contingent election to be held in the House of Representatives. This would have happened even though Joe Biden had won the popular vote by more than seven million votes.

This discrepancy between the Electoral College and the popular vote is generating growing controversy about the electoral system. Moreover, reports of voting irregularities have done nothing to help the electorate feel particularly secure about the integrity of the process. And here another threat must be added. At a time of major income inequality and significant geographical differences between the states, there is a risk of the Electoral College systematically overrepresenting the opinions of a relatively small number of people owing to the structure of the Electoral College itself. As it is currently constituted, each state has two votes in the Electoral College, regardless of the size of its population, plus the additional votes matching its number of members of the House of Representatives. This format overrepresents the small and medium-sized states to the detriment of the large ones. All these objections have led US citizens to increasingly oppose the Electoral College. Six out of 10 would prefer the winner to be the candidate who attracts most votes at the national level, with increasing division along party lines, with Democrats declaring themselves mostly in favour and the Republicans more divided.

The US voting system is therefore structured around the states, which are the important jurisdictional unit of the presidential elections. This causes the political campaigns to focus on a relatively small number of pivotal swing states. These are highly sought-after states that have historically swung between voting for one party or the other in the presidential elections, whereas most states vote systematically for the same party (between 2000 and 2020, 36 states voted for the same party). For this reason, these states receive a disproportionate amount of attention from polling companies and candidates, who spend more than 75% of their campaign budgets on them, and the claim that ‘every vote counts’ becomes especially apposite in these cases. If no candidate wins a majority of Electoral College votes (they are tied on 269) the presidential election passes to the House of Representatives for a second round. However, in contrast to the usual practice of the House, each state would only receive one vote, decided by the party that controls the state’s delegation to the House of Representatives.

The current electoral cycle will once again be determined by the decisive swing states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin (known as the Rust Belt); and Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina (known as the Sun Belt).

When Joe Biden was the Democrat candidate after winning the primaries, his victory required winning the Rust Belt, while the Sun Belt was virtually written off as lost. With Kamala Harris, the party is once again competitive in all seven states and the possible combinations for winning the 270 electoral college votes have risen, while the possibilities of the Republican remain almost unchanged.

Various scenarios have been mentioned depending on the campaign strategy. One possibility is that Harris flips the Biden plan of taking the Rust Belt and claims victory by concentrating on the Sun Belt. This would mean not relying on gaining ground among non-university educated white voters –reducing the possibility of victory in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin– but winning an even higher percentage of white university graduates and ethnically Asian voters than in 2020. She would also need to match the previous election’s results among Black and Latino voters, which would enable her to retain Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, enough to secure a majority of electoral college votes.

A second scenario involves the materialisation of Trump’s supposed gains among Black, Latino and ethnically Asian voters, propelling his return to the White House. Although he would lose the national popular vote, he would win the presidency if he increased his percentage of support among these minorities, gaining Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Another possibility is that Harris secures a good result among voters aged 65 and over, which would enable her to retain Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, accumulating 276 electoral college votes. If this were the case, it would be the first time a Democrat candidate managed to win the support of this group since Al Gore, and would come at a time in which Harris is gaining ground among young voters, albeit not enough. Although neither campaign wants to lose votes, the replacement of young voters by their older counterparts is potentially positive for Harris given that there are more older people in the US than young people under 30 and they are more likely to sign up to the electoral register and cast their ballot. And although the exact figures differ according to state, older voters constitute a much larger part of the electorate than younger voters in some of the swing states.

Another possible scenario is a chaotic electoral result –with few patterns or consistent tendencies in the battleground states– which could lead to a narrow victory for Trump. A case in point would be the mid-term elections of 2022, which produced very different results from one state to another, with the Democrats doing well in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Colorado and the Republicans dominating in New York, California and Florida.

Finally, it is important not to overlook what is normally referred to as the ‘October surprise’, an event, whether deliberate or spontaneous, that can influence the result in November. Some believe that it has already taken place and it could be the dockers’ strike on the East Coast, or Iran’s attack on Israel, which threatens an even wider war, or the most recent 165-page filing by Special Counsel Jack Smith in the federal case against Donald Trump for subverting the 2020 presidential election. Or perhaps the surprise is still to come. Most commentators tend to believe that such a surprise no longer applies, however.

The 2016 presidential race was influenced a month before the election by the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails which, according to some, cost her the election. The distinctive characteristic of the current presidential election, however, is immobility. In fact, the only thing that has seriously shifted the polls was Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race and his replacement by Kamala Harris as the Democrat candidate. But neither Biden’s poor debating performance, nor the first assassination attempt on Trump, nor the second caused a major change in the polls. This stability reflects the calcified state of current US politics, with US citizens politically split down the middle and deeply polarised in their opinions.

The conclusion is that everything remains up for grabs in a tight presidential race, although Kamala Harris has clearly increased her possible combinations for securing 270 electors. But as well as the presidential campaign, it is important not to lose sight of what is at stake in the Senate and the House of Representatives, which is by no means trivial. Regardless of who wins the election, if one of the two chambers falls into the hands of the opposing party, it will change the victor’s options when it comes to governing.

2. Congress

The 435 seats of the House of Representatives are also up for re-election in November –Representatives’ terms last for two years– as well as a third of the 100 Senate seats –Senators’ terms last for six years–. This difference in the duration of terms means that the House of Representatives tends to reflect popular passions and passing enthusiasms, whereas the Senate tempers the enthusiasm with wisdom and experience.

Congress is the branch closest to the ground. It is the point of entry through which ordinary citizens try to influence politics and unlikely as it may seem, congressmen and women devote considerable time to finding out what their voters want. Congress is also the place where the contradictory opinions and priorities of a large, diverse and energetic country come together and frequently collide. It forces its members to find enough points in common to be able to pass laws in their own chamber, in the other chamber, and subsequently obtain the President’s signature. It requires negotiation and compromise, and when Congress works well, it produces legislation capable of garnering widespread support throughout the country. Lastly, part of the work of Congress consists of controlling and supervising the executive branch. There can be no doubt that this function can be used to pursue partisan ends, but also to ensure that the institutions and bureaucrats are truly serving the US people as they should. It would be no surprise if a Republican majority were to constitute a partner less willing to arrive at compromises with a Democrat White House, with a legislative blockade and an aggressive use of Congressional tools to attack and goad the new Administration. The same may be expected if the opposite holds true, although the Biden Administration has shown that it still believes in bipartisan politics, because during its mandate it has managed to push through three major legislative packages with the help of Republican votes.

Among the powers wielded by the upper chamber is the ability to institute dismissal procedures against senior federal officers (impeachment), but it is also charged with exercising the power of evaluation and approval in matters of treaties and plays an important role in the confirmation (or rejection) of certain nominations (around 1,200 of the President’s 4,000 political nominations), such as ambassadors and senior judges. It also proposes legislation, draws up and amends draft bills, oversees the federal budget and approves the treaties with foreign nations negotiated by the executive power.

Everything seems to indicate that the Senate could revert to Republican hands. But the Senate usually requires a majority of 60 out of 100 to get most legislative initiatives over the hurdle of delaying tactics, known as the filibuster, making it essential to find consensus with the other side. And if this cannot be achieved, government is fundamentally done through executive orders. Recent forecasts suggest that whoever wins it will be a chamber almost as evenly split as the current one (49 Republican senators and 51 Democrats). In the event of a tie in the number of senators, majority control will depend on the candidate who wins the presidential race (the Vice-president has the casting vote, if necessary).

A practically tied Senate would therefore limit the ambitions of both the Republican and the Democrat agendas and the only bearing they would be able to exert on the fiscal domain would rely on a procedure known as ‘reconciliation’, which enables the Senate to use a simple majority to modify income and expenditure. This is particularly important for next year, when many of the cuts imposed during the first Trump Administration come to an end.

For its part, the House of Representatives can initiate impeachment against federal office-holders by voting for articles of dismissal that are then sent to the Senate; it is also empowered to approve and reject presidential nominations and international treaties. But it also has the power to investigate specific cases and matters related to the executive, judicial and other branches of the state, which includes the authority to summon witnesses and documents, hold public hearings and send the results to committees for review and create specific committees for this purpose. This power of oversight has been used aggressively by the Republicans in the last two years, for example against the head of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the son of the incumbent President, Hunter Biden.

The lower chamber also holds the purse strings. On its own the House of Representatives cannot pass bills into law, but it can refuse to endorse them, or to grant them money, and it can threaten to shut down government. The current Republican majority has sought to hold the debt limit hostage in an attempt to force spending cuts and has frozen additional funding of Ukraine for months, and could do so again in the future. More spending aimed at countries such as Ukraine and Taiwan, or to confront the world’s authoritarian regimes, could prove even more difficult if the lower chamber is in Republican hands, because they seem to be determined to go ahead with cutting what they deem to be superfluous expenditure.

It is not clear who is going to control the 435 seats of the House of Representatives, which is a toss-up between the two parties, albeit with a narrow advantage for the Democrats. Securing a majority is in any event crucial for both parties.

3. Transition

After the election is held on 5 November, the 538 electors travel to the capitals of their respective states –on the Monday following the second Wednesday of December– to elect the President of the US. These citizens, chosen for their loyalty to their political party, will vote for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their state. Here something comes into play that until recently had remained in relative obscurity: the counting and certification of the ballot.

Immediately after the 2020 presidential election, at least 17 election officers from the counties of six swing states tried to block the certification of the total votes cast in their respective counties, alleging electoral fraud. Such an attempt to block certification was hitherto unprecedented. Although all the attempts foundered, the contested certifications might potentially have derailed the election.

In 2022, during the mid-term elections, at least 22 county election officials voted in favour of delaying certification in key battleground states, an increase of almost 30% compared with 2020. In some cases the officials managed to stall –although ultimately not block– the certification.

In the first eight months of 2024, at least eight county officials have already voted against certifying primary or special election results. Everything suggests that interference in certification could return after the 2024 presidential election, given that the trend that has been evident since 2020.

It is possible that there will once again be a degree of chaos and confusion in the certifications at the local level –less so at the state level– but dozens of local officials are already lined up and prepared to ensure that the certification process goes ahead with the changes instituted since 2020 to prevent political interference in the process. If a local entity refuses to certify, the courts will intervene to force certification. Despite misgivings it is therefore necessary to trust the process.

When the electors have voted for the presidential candidate who has won the popular vote in their respective states, the next step is a joint session of Congress held at the Capitol building to count the electoral votes and declare the result of the election. Since the mid-20th century, this joints session has been held on 6 January at 13:00. The incumbent Vice-president chairs the meeting and opens the votes of each state in alphabetical order. At the end of the count, the Vice-president announces the name of the next President. At this point the presidential race will have officially ended, paving the way to the presidential inauguration on 20 January.

The states expect that their electors will respect the will of their voters in the Capitol. In other words, the electors pledge to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state. However, the constitution does not oblige them to do so, which enables there to be ‘faithless electors’. In 1796 Samuel Miles was the first to cast his vote in favour of a candidate who had not won the popular vote in his state. In the 2016 election, seven electors ignored the dictates of the popular vote in their state, this being the highest number in any modern election. In a highly polarised political context in which people harbour strong feelings towards particular candidates, it is possible –but still rather unlikely– that future faithless electors could tip the presidency in one direction or another. However, 38 states and Washington DC have laws in place that force the electors to vote for their party’s official candidate. A 2020 Supreme Court decision ruled that the states are authorised to impose sanctions –including fines, replacement as an elector and a possible trial– against ‘faithless electors’ or those who vote against the popular vote in their state.

Moreover, after the assault on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, Congress approved a series of reforms that would make it more difficult for partisan actors to manipulate the results of future presidential elections. In 2022 the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act gave even greater clarity to the specific functions and duties of the Congress and Vice-president in counting the Electoral College certificates and ensures that the Congress receives and considers the electoral votes that truly reflect the election results.

It is said that if Kamala Harris wins the election on 5 November, she will need to defend her victory until January precisely due to the uncertainties surrounding the count and certification of the votes, above all in light of the Republican candidate’s declarations and the fear that he is already manoeuvring in advance of what may take place. The institutions have taken steps to ensure that the final results are a true reflection of the votes cast. There may be episodes of chaos and confusion mainly at a local level and, in particular, pre-meditated news stories about electoral fraud and doubts about the results. But nobody doubts that whoever finally takes possession of the White House will be the winner of the contest.

4. Transfer of powers

The constitution has virtually nothing to say about presidential transitions, apart from the fact that the next President will take up office on 20 January. But there is a federal law, the Presidential Transition Act, originally approved in 1963, which establishes certain processes and requirements that apply both before and after elections, in the event of a new President coming to power. It does not say anything about the outgoing President having to invite his successor to the White House or personally cooperate with him in any way. This is only a tradition, but a tradition that no outgoing Administration had ever failed to observe until it was broken in 2020 with Donald Trump as outgoing President, who also decided not to attend his successor’s inauguration.

A peaceful handover of power –above all from one political party to another– is arguably the ultimate expression of the rule of law. It was George Washington’s great contribution to the US political tradition when he voluntarily gave up the presidency. The spectacle of an outgoing President –Donald Trump– behaving in a way that had never been seen before was profoundly corrosive to US democracy.

The process of presidential transition therefore exists in a symbolic way, with the ritual of one President yielding power to another displaying a society that respects the law, where the will of the electorate holds sway. But there is also a practical level. The federal government of the US is one of the largest organisations in the world and the process of transferring control from one group of political actors to another is extraordinarily complex.

The presidential transition is therefore also a process of planning a new presidential mandate. And the presidential candidates achieve this by establishing transition teams, organisations that are legally separate from the presidential campaigns. The transition teams are responsible, among other things, for investigating the backgrounds of personnel, for planning policies and management programmes for turning campaign promises into governance. There are thousands of real-time decisions that have to be taken from the moment the future President takes office. And a longstanding tradition has developed whereby, as soon as the result of the election is known, the outgoing Administration –if the Administration is changing– undertakes to help the incoming Administration take up the reins.

The key is that whoever occupies the White House should be ready to govern from the very first day of taking up residence. An incoming President is responsible for making more than 4,000 political nominations, overseeing a budget of approximately US$6 trillion and managing an enormous organisation that employs more than two million federal workers and more than two million service personnel and reserve forces. If the process is delayed or is not completed effectively, it could even have implications for national security. In the elections that took place in 2000, when the Supreme Court took 35 days to rule on the electoral dispute in Florida between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the Clinton Administration decided not to give access to either of the two teams and wait until the final resolution of the dispute. This led to a truncated transition that had a negative impact on national security, as the Commission on the 9/11 attacks on the US found, concluding that the shortened transition from the Clinton to the Bush Administration was a factor that contributed to the country’s vulnerability to terrorist attacks.

Conclusions

Only a few weeks remain before the 5 November polling day in the US, thereby bringing to an end a tight race that will be decided by a handful of states and relatively few votes. But it is not only the presidency that is at stake; the result in the Senate and the House of Representatives will determine the future Administration’s room for manoeuvre.

But the contest will not end there. If Trump wins, the US should prepare for a transfer of power to a new Administration that is shaping up to be disruptive, especially on the domestic stage. If Harris wins, she will also need to defend her victory over Donald Trump until the day of her inauguration. However, the institutions have taken sufficient steps to ensure that there is a peaceful transition of power in spite of the narratives being advanced by Trump and the suspicion that he could try to repeat what happened between November 2020 and January 2021.

Even if the transfer passes off smoothly, the narratives of the Republican Party are already having a tremendously corrosive effect. In addition, there is the damage being inflicted on the position of the US in the world and the trust that citizens may have in their government. There is a significant difference between wanting US democracy to work, while acknowledging severe problems, and a widespread effort to undermine people’s fundamental faith in the democratic process.","The US elections: campaign, transition and inauguration - Elcano Royal Institute  Real Instituto Elcano",Real Instituto Elcano,https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/the-us-elections-campaign-transition-and-inauguration/

Assassination attempts, criminal convictions and a change in political opponent couldn’t stop Republican Donald Trump winning the 2024 US election.

Trump swept to a decisive victory on Wednesday morning after winning several crucial battleground states.

In three months’ time, the 45th president of the United States will become the 47th at an inauguration at the US Capitol.

It’s the same location his supporters stormed and ransacked with a goal of stopping the certification of Joe Biden’s election on 6 January 2021.

Since then, Trump has made a remarkable political comeback that culminated with a victory speech to a sea of supporters wearing his iconic red MAGA caps.

""America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” he said to a crowd heaving with excitement.

At the same time, hope had drained away from Kamala Harris's supporters, who were leaving in droves from the Democratic Party event where she was hoping to make her own victory speech.

Instead, she gave a concession speech telling tearful supporters to ""never give up"" on their ideals and pledging a peaceful transfer of power.

The vote was held as experts sound the alarm on political and societal polarization worldwide.

Here's what to know about how US presidential elections work.

Tens of millions of voters in the United States went to the polls this week for the 2024 US presidential election.

The vote, held on 5 November, had gripped much of the world’s attention in recent months, with experts noting that the results could have a significant impact on the global economy as well as have consequences on international issues ranging from the climate crisis to the reorientation of global supply chains.

But how exactly do Americans pick their president? Here’s what to know about how US presidential elections work.

US election: Hitting the polls

Elections for the US president and vice president occur every four years.

The vote follows a lengthy primary process in which the two major political parties—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party—choose a candidate through state caucuses and primary votes. Party delegates from all 50 US states then officially nominate the candidate at a national nominating convention.

This year, the Republican candidate was former President Donald Trump and the Democratic candidate was current Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris formally became the Democratic nominee in August after current President Joe Biden ended his bid for re-election in late July.

For months, the two nominees courted voters, urging them to vote early and show up on election day: Tuesday, 5 November 2024.

The date of the election stems from a rule that the US Congress enacted in 1845 that mandated that US states appoint presidential electors every four years on “the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November.” At the time, the US was a largely agrarian country so the early-November date allowed the handful of Americans who could vote at the time to access the polls after the autumn harvest and before the onset of winter.

Today, Americans must register to vote in their home state ahead of the election. They can then mail in an absentee ballot, vote early at a designated polling place or vote on election day.

The Electoral College

The election of the US president is not decided through a direct popular vote. Instead, presidential elections use a process known as the Electoral College.

In this system, each of the 50 US states is allocated a number of electoral votes based on their representation in the US Congress. California, for instance, has 54 electoral votes while Wyoming has three; the total number of electoral votes is 538.

When voters cast their ballots, they are in fact voting for a slate of state electors that are pledged to their chosen candidate.

In most states, the candidate who receives the majority of the popular vote wins all of the state’s electoral votes. This is known as the winner-takes-all system. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, use a proportional allocation system to award electoral votes. A candidate must receive a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) to win the presidency.

Given that each state has different rules on how to count the votes, the election results can take days to be finalised.

Following the election, the state electors will gather in their state capitals to formally cast their votes for president and vice president. Then, in January, a joint session of Congress is held to certify the election results. The next US president will take office on 20 January 2025.

The Electoral College, which was established in the US Constitution, has been the subject of much debate given that the process can lead to candidates losing the popular vote but winning the electoral vote. This scenario occurred in the elections of 2016 and 2000 as well as three times in the 1800s.

In recent years, voter turnout in the US has increased. In 2020, for instance, over 158 million people voted in the presidential election. The turnout marked 65.9% of the voting age population and a significant increase from the 59.2% seen in 2016.

'Ideological and cultural divisions'

The US presidential vote came in a historic year for elections, with more than 2 billion people in 50 countries heading to the polls in 2024. The vote also came as experts are increasingly sounding the alarm on political and societal polarization in the US and around the world.

The World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risks Report defines societal polarization as “ideological and cultural divisions within and across communities leading to declining social stability, gridlocks in decision-making, economic disruption and increased political polarization.”

The report found that societal polarization ranks among the top three most severe risks presently and over a two-year time horizon. Over a 10-year period, polarization falls to the ninth most severe risk.

The report adds that societal polarization was a “consistent concern across nearly all stakeholder groupings.”

LONDON — On Tuesday, Nov. 5, millions of Americans will cast their votes to elect the 47th president of the United States.

The act of voting on the first Tuesday that follows a Monday in November is a tradition that reaches back almost 180 years.

The decision in 1845 to pass a federal law to nominate a midweek polling day in the fall to choose the most powerful leader in the free world has its roots in the industrial makeup of 19th-century America, says Jessica Linker, an assistant professor in history at Northeastern University.

By the middle of the 1800s, states were increasingly making the right to vote available to non-land owning white men over the age of 21 (equal voting rights were not achieved until the 1960s). With that expansion of the popular vote came a desire to streamline the presidential voting process and move away from the previous system that allowed states to hold elections within a 34-day period before the first Wednesday in December.

Aware that early voting declarations could have a bearing on turnout and even voting behavior in states voting later, Congress wanted to create a single election day.

Why did they select a Tuesday?

“This is where agriculture comes in,” Linker explains.

Congress was keen, Linker says, to ensure the presidential polling day did not “disenfranchise” the vast numbers of people working in the agricultural sector at the time.

“They were aware that they had to call it at a time when it was not a difficulty to go to the polls,” she explains, “because the polls weren’t necessarily down the street from you. You had to travel to them and so part of the logic was that people might need a day to travel. Traveling might be a two-day affair, and so that ruled out certain days of the week — and this is how they ended up with Tuesday.”

Why not a Wednesday?

Linker says there were “calculations about what day of the week was not going to be a burden” for the farming community, with Wednesdays ruled out because that was a popular market day in many places.

Religion was also a factor, she notes. The centrality of Christianity to many of the country’s population meant polling day could not be a Monday as that would involve potentially having to set off on a Sunday when most Christians would attend church.

Christianity is also said to have played a part in specifying that polling day should be the Tuesday “after the first Monday,” with the provision in place to prevent it from falling on Nov. 1 — a day that some Christians observe as All Saints’ Day.

November was selected also for agrarian reasons. It was after the harvest, before the planting season and avoided the arrival of the worst of the winter weather.

But Linker argues that mid-19th century America should not purely be seen as a nation of farmers — with New York, Philadelphia and Boston all thriving cities at the time. It was simply that urban dwellers would have been less of a consideration for politicians when selecting a nationwide polling date.

Not strictly agricultural

“I would caution against talking about America [in this period] as being strictly agricultural because it has quite a few large cities that are taking part in the voting,” she says.

“The agricultural aspect gets emphasized because that was their [Congress’] concern when trying to figure out logistically, ‘How are we going to do this?’",Why is the US presidential election held on a Tuesday in November?

With all states now counted, US President-elect Donald Trump has won 312 of 538 electoral votes, including all seven battleground states, while Democratic rival Kamala Harris secured 226.

Republicans also lead the popular vote by about 4 million votes, with 95 percent of votes counted.

So, how do these results compare to 2020, and which states have shifted most to the right?

States ranked from most red to most blue

The Republicans won majorities in 31 out of the country’s 50 states with their biggest victories in Wyoming (72.3 percent), West Virginia (70.1 percent), North Dakota (67.5 percent), Idaho (66.8 percent) and Oklahoma (66.1 percent).

Meanwhile, the Democrats won 19 states as well as the capital DC where they received 92.4 percent of votes, followed by Vermont (64.3 percent), Maryland (61.5 percent), Massachusetts (61.2 percent) and Hawaii (60.6 percent).

The table below shows each state’s results, from the most Republican votes to the least with 95 percent of votes reported nationwide.

Battleground state results

Leading up to the November 5 elections, pollsters identified seven battleground states with polls within a few percentage points, making them too close to call.

In the US Electoral College, a candidate needs at least 270 out of 538 Electoral votes to win the presidency.

Each state is allocated a certain number of Electoral votes based on its population. Some states consistently favour one party, making them safe for either Democrats or Republicans, while “battleground” or “swing states” can shift, making them crucial in deciding the election.

The seven battleground states, totalling 93 Electoral votes, included:

Pennsylvania (19), Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10) and Nevada (6).

US election results: 2020 v 2024

In 2020, Democrats, led by Joe Biden, won 306 electoral votes across 25 states and the capital, Washington, DC, while Trump secured 232 by winning the remaining 25 states.

In 2024, Donald Trump’s Republican party flipped six states to win the 2024 election.

All 50 states shifted red in 2024

Republicans have won a larger share of votes in every state in 2024 compared to 2020, with 95 percent of votes counted nationwide.

In the 2020 election, Trump received 37.74 percent of the vote in New York, while Biden secured 60.87 percent. However, in 2024, Trump earned 44.17 percent of the vote, compared to 55.83 percent for Harris. This marks the biggest shift, with a 6.43 percent change, and nearly 97 percent of the vote counted.

Other notable swings to the right include New Jersey (4.92 percent), Florida (4.88 percent), California (4.61 percent) and Massachusetts (4.38 percent).

In 2024, more than half the world’s population across 77 countries was eligible to go to the polls, though in some cases the voting was for sham elections like in Russia. But even more people than that are going to the polls this year in the U.S. Presidential election, not literally but figuratively, with their hearts and minds. As the two Presidential campaigns scramble to reach the very few remaining Americans whose votes are up for grabs, billions of people across literally every country in the world are paying close attention.

In a recent swing through Singapore, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Australia, across dozens and dozens of meetings with government officials, members of civil society, and diplomats, the conversation inevitably turned to the U.S. elections. This is hardly a new phenomenon. People around the world have been closely following the U.S. presidential campaign for months. The level of interest of people I met in a multi-country visit to Europe in February was as high as it was in Asia in October. At the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September, the two topics at the global gathering that dominated the hallway conversations were the war in Gaza and Lebanon, and the U.S. Presidential election.

People inevitably ask, “Who is going to win?” Many are as anxious and stressed-out by the American elections as most of America is. Fundamentally though, what they are most interested in, is understanding what the American election results will mean for them.

They know the outcome will have an impact, one way or another, on them and on their communities. While the world is very different today than it was in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, the United States is still the world’s only super-power. When America’s democracy is jolted, people on the other side of the world shake.

After the end of the Cold War, the American democratic and electoral systems were held up as models, often as eagerly imported as exported. In 2024, there is broad recognition at home and abroad that, while the U.S. models have many strengths, they are not without their weaknesses, some of which are uniquely American.

That explains why questions about the likely outcome are often paired with surprisingly well-informed questions about swing states, court cases, polling, voter turn-out, and campaign messaging. Many foreigners know more about the U.S. election system than many Americans. But even the most well-informed foreigners I know generally have a hard time understanding the logic of the electoral college that has five times resulted in a President who lost the popular vote.

At a time when Israeli and Middle Eastern security is shifting at breakneck speed, the coming U.S. elections have tremendous implications for the region.

On a few crucial fronts, policy areas will remain the same no matter which candidate wins. China will likely remain the main rival of the United States, and Washington will seek to curtail its reach, setting the stage for constant pressure to lock out Chinese influence in the Middle East. Second, either administration would almost definitely resume President Joe Biden’s pursuit of an Israeli-Saudi bargain. Third, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump voice strong commitment to Israel’s security. However, this is where the similarities end.

Generally, Trump represents a high risk–high reward path for regional actors. He is viewed by leaders and experts as willing to use force against enemies, but his reputation for volatility could lead U.S. regional allies to worry whether current security commitments will persist. Harris is expected to maintain the current administration’s approach, supporting regional allies while aiming to limit armed conflicts involving major shows of U.S. force.

On Iran, Trump’s first term was marked by withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the Iran nuclear deal), a “maximum pressure” sanction campaign, and the assassination of Qasem Soleiman. For those reasons, it is understandable that Tehran views Trump’s possible return to office with concern. Harris recently declared Iran the United States’ greatest adversary. Nevertheless, she is more likely to opt for negotiations to roll back Iran’s nuclear program than use force.

Both candidates have called for an end to the war between Israel and Iran’s proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militias, but mean different things by it. Trump has voiced support for high degrees of force on Israel’s part to achieve its goals. Meanwhile, Harris consistently voices support for a cease-fire and hostage deal, and expresses concern for the well-being of Palestinian civilians. Still, she has ruled out an arms embargo on Israel. Whether she would expand restrictions on the sale of specific munitions remains to be seen.

The two are also likely to diverge on the relationship between a Saudi-Israeli deal and broader questions of regional peace. Harris will likely connect Saudi-Israeli normalization to Israeli commitment to Palestinian statehood. She will also likely intensify current sanctions against violent Jewish settlers. Trump, for his part, would likely support Israeli-Saudi normalization without a Palestinian component, and could endorse Israeli annexation in the West Bank.

For Israel, this amounts to a mixed balance. Trump will likely grant Israel more freedom of action, but his policy on the war in Ukraine could have the paradoxical effect of boosting Iran. Trump calls for an end to the war, even if that entails Ukrainian defeat, while Harris would maintain support for Kyiv. A Russian victory and corollary Ukrainian defeat would favor the anti-liberal democratic alliance in which Iran and its proxies play a key part.",Why the U.S. Presidential Election Matters for the Middle East  Council on Foreign Relations,Council on Foreign Relations,https://www.cfr.org/councilofcouncils/global-memos/why-us-presidential-election-matters-middle-east

The US presidential election has divided a nation, but scientists seem to be on the same page. Researchers inside and outside the United States overwhelmingly favour the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to roughly 2,000 readers who responded to a Nature survey. What’s more, one-third of the researchers rooting for her say it might affect their plans for where they live or study if the Republican candidate Donald Trump wins on 5 November.

The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?

Some nine out of ten respondents — around one-half of whom say they are based outside the United States — think that the US election is important, and could have big impacts on everything from climate change to public health and science policy (see ‘A weighty election’). Although the survey is not statistically representative of Nature readers or the scientific community at large, it points to widespread anxiety about the future of the United States and its global status among researchers. In particular, many respondents expressed fear about the rise of extremism and authoritarian rhetoric under former president Trump.

“Part of me thinks you should run face first into the fire” and help to preserve US democracy, says Erik Poppleton, a US biophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany, who took the survey. “But right now, if Trump is elected, I feel I would be more comfortable staying in Europe, which is sad because I want to come back.”

Poppleton is not alone. Roughly 77% of respondents identified themselves as researchers, and 86% said the election would affect whether the United States remains an attractive place to pursue a scientific career. “A country that doesn’t believe in facts is not a safe place to build a career in science,” wrote one respondent. Responses were solicited earlier this month on the Nature website, on social media and in the Nature Briefing, an e-mail newsletter.

Climate matters

Climate change topped the list of reasons that survey respondents gave as to why the election was important to them personally, with 34% of people selecting it. The emphasis on global warming probably reflects the reality that the United States is the world’s second largest greenhouse-gas emitter and could, on its own, drive the world over the climate cliff. Although Harris has promised to tackle the climate crisis by continuing to invest in green energy, Trump says that he will ramp up fossil-fuel development.

Source: Nature survey.

As for why the election is important to science, respondents once again put progress on climate change at the top of their list (26%), alongside concerns about science funding (24%) and global science policy (23%).

A minority said that such fears are overblown, however, arguing that science will proceed regardless of politics, or that neither major candidate appears ready to tackle the grand challenges faced by the United States and the world. “Objective, unbiased science that is based on facts will always have a venue to improve the human condition,” wrote one respondent, who said that they would prefer the cartoon character Bugs Bunny for president. “The issue is whether or not people want to hear the facts.”

Concerns and priorities

A solid majority of those surveyed — 86% — favour Harris, and the percentage is roughly the same whether people reported being based in the United States (944 respondents) or abroad (842 respondents) (see ‘Support for Harris’). Still, 6% of respondents preferred Trump and another 4% said they preferred alternative candidates, including Jill Stein, who is standing for the US Green Party, and the avowed socialist Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Source: Nature survey.

Concerns and priorities differed substantially among Harris and Trump supporters. Those who said that they prefer Harris were more likely to cite climate change alongside issues of security, social justice and public health as their chief concerns. Some also said that trust in science is important. Whereas Trump presents himself as being guided by political convictions, “Harris and her party show willingness to update policies based on evidence”, wrote Kate Radford, a researcher in biochemistry and biophysics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “This is the heart of science.”

Those who voiced their support for Trump emphasized issues of economics and security as their main concerns. Nature reached out to one such respondent, Jacob van Rensburg, an economist at a shipping organization in Johannesburg, South Africa, who said he thought that a second Trump administration would be more likely to bring the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East to an end. “Science funding — in particular climate-change funding — is irrelevant when widespread war is going on,” van Rensburg said.

Stay or go?

Researchers based in the United States were more than twice as likely as their international counterparts to say that they would consider important changes to their lives if their preferred candidate loses (see ‘Dilemmas looming’), a sentiment that differed by political preference. Harris supporters were 50% more likely to say that they would consider relocating or changing where they study than were those who prefer Trump.

Source: Nature survey.

Respondents to the Nature survey included scientists wondering about whether to come to the United States, as well as US and immigrant scientists wondering whether to stay in the country. In many cases, respondents referred to the danger of a second Trump presidency. Trump has spurred concerns about racism and xenophobia owing to his anti-immigrant rhetoric and various policies implemented during his 2017–21 presidency that made it harder for foreign students and scientists to study and work in the United States.

One respondent said he already left the United States once, during Trump’s presidency, fearing that the country was in danger of becoming a failed democracy. He moved back because of a job opportunity, but says he is glad that he never gave up the citizenship of his home country. “I worry that I might have to try to leave again,” he wrote.","The US election is monumental for science, say Nature readers — here’s why  Nature.com",Nature.com,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03479-y

Since our last two reports, the U.S. government has taken many actions revealing cyber and influence activity from foreign adversaries related to election 2024. Most recently, that includes revealing malicious Iranian cyber actors’ sending of “stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign” to both individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign and U.S. media organizations, and the indictment of three Iranian actors for the hack-and-leak operation targeting the Trump-Vance campaign.

We also noted in our last report that while Iranian actors have focused their cyber-influence operations on the Trump campaign, Russian actors decisively pivoted toward the Harris campaign once she entered the race. Since then, Russian actors continue to integrate generative AI into their content, Iranian groups ramp up their preparations to enable cyber-influence operations, while Chinese actors shift focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of Congress. Russian actors have notably attempted to target the Harris-Walz campaign by attacking the candidates’ characters.

With a particular focus on the 48 hours before and after Election Day, voters, government institutions, candidates, and parties must remain vigilant against deceptive and suspicious activity online. Early detection and fact-checking remain essential to countering these efforts and maintaining election integrity.

We discuss this activity in our fifth election report by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) released today.

Russia stays focused on the Harris-Walz campaign

Russian operatives continue to take steps to undermine the Harris-Walz campaign. Russian actors continue to create AI-enhanced deepfake videos about Vice President Harris. In one video, Harris is depicted as allegedly making derogatory comments about former President Donald Trump. In another from a Kremlin-aligned troll farm we track as Storm-1516, Harris is accused of illegal poaching in Zambia. Finally, another video spreads disinformation about Democratic vice president nominee Tim Walz, gaining more than 5 million views on X in the first 24 hours.

While most of these videos received minimal engagement, they underscore Russia’s ongoing use of both traditional and AI-generated content to influence U.S. audiences and stoke political discord. We have also seen some actors shifting their content publishing strategy from Telegram to X to reach U.S. audiences.

Escalating hostilities in the Middle East have not slowed Iran’s cyber-influence operations

Iran has proved that it can run multiple operations against varying targets simultaneously. Despite escalating tensions with Israel, Iran continues its efforts to influence U.S. audiences. Most recently, MTAC observed Iranian activity, disguised as “Bushnell’s Men,” calling on Americans to boycott the elections due to the candidates’ support for Israel. The group’s previous efforts to incite anti-Israeli protests at universities further illustrate their use of divisive social issues to sow conflict among communities in the U.S.

Additionally, the Iranian cyber group Microsoft tracks as Cotton Sandstorm has been actively scouting election-related websites and media outlets, suggesting preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears. The actor’s history of election interference and their pattern of cyber-influence operations underscores the persistent threat they pose.

China targets down-ballot candidates and members of Congress

Chinese influence operations have focused on down-ballot Republican candidates and members of Congress that advocate for anti-Chinese policies. This includes campaigns against Rep. Barry Moore, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, and Sen. Marco Rubio (not currently up for re-election this cycle). Actors have parroted antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption, and promoted opposition candidates. While not always resulting in high levels of engagement, these efforts demonstrate China’s sustained attempts influence U.S. politics across the board.

Remaining vigilant to online threats.

During times of heightened emotion, conflict, and competition, manipulated images, audio, and video often travel further and faster across audiences than during an average news cycle. Foreign actors have proven nimble and capable of inserting deceptive content and distributing it rapidly during these moments. We expect Russia, Iran, and China to continue their efforts, including using AI, and may employ tactics that seek to cast doubt about the integrity of the election’s outcome. MTAC will continue to monitor this activity and provide updates publicly to promote education and protect institutions from any form of foreign interference.

Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party.

When does Trump become US president again?

BBC's Caitríona Perry explains what key moments will follow election night

Republican Donald Trump will be the next US president - after a decisive victory that will send him back to the White House. His defeated opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, urged her supporters to accept Trump's win, and insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power. He will be the first former president to return to office in more than 130 years, and - at 78 - the oldest man ever elected to the role.

When will the election results be confirmed?

Trump has already been congratulated by world leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the UK's Keir Starmer, but the official presidential election results are not yet confirmed. There had been fears that extremely close races in some of the key battleground ""swing"" states might have left the results uncertain. But earlier-than-expected wins in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, coupled with victories in solidly Republican states, meant Trump reached the magic 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.

CBS, the BBC's broadcasting partner in the US, projected Donald Trump as the overall winner just after 05:30 EST (10:30 GMT) on 6 November, the day after the election. However, it could still take days or even weeks for the detailed election results to be confirmed officially in every state.

Is Donald Trump now president?

No. Trump becomes the president-elect, and his running mate JD Vance becomes the vice-president elect. Trump will be sworn in at the presidential inauguration on Monday, 20 January 2025, at which point he legally assumes the power and responsibilities of the presidency. After winning the 2016 election. Trump was sworn in as president in January 2017 and served until 2021.

What happens between election day and the inauguration?

Once every valid vote has been included in the final results, a process known as the electoral college confirms the election result. In each state a varying number of electoral college votes are up for grabs. It is securing these – and not the backing of voters themselves – that ultimately wins the presidency.

Generally, states award all of their electoral college votes to whoever wins the popular vote, and this is confirmed after meetings on 17 December. The new US Congress then meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president. As the outgoing vice-president, Kamala Harris will preside over this process. It was this meeting of Congress, to certify the election results, that Trump's supporters tried to stop, when they marched on the US Capitol in 2021 after Trump refused to concede defeat to Joe Biden.

What do the incoming president and vice-president do now?

Trump and Vance will work with their transition team to organise the handover from President Biden’s outgoing administration. They will identify their policy priorities, start vetting the candidates who will take up key roles in the new administration, and prepare to take over the functions of government. At his victory rally, Trump hinted that the former Republican presidential candidate and vaccine sceptic Robert J Kennedy could be given a healthcare role. Tech billionaire Elon Musk is also expected to feature in the new administration. Trump previously said he would ask Mr Musk to tackle government waste. Trump and his team will also begin receiving classified national security briefings covering current threats and ongoing military operations. The president-elect and vice-president-elect also receive mandatory protection from the US Secret Service. Trump's team says he has accepted a traditional invitation from Biden to visit the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the administrations. The outgoing president also typically attends the inauguration of the incoming president, although Trump chose to boycott the 2021 event. Trump did, however, follow the tradition begun by Ronald Reagan of leaving a handwritten note in the Oval Office for his successor to read. At the time, President Biden told reporters that his predecessor had left ""a very generous letter”.

The U.S. is a presidential republic with a bicameral legislature. The president is elected by absolute majority (at least 270 electoral votes) in the Electoral College to serve a four-year term. The two chambers of Congress are the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state has two senators, and the number of a state’s seats in the House of Representatives is determined by its population. Each state receives Electoral College votes equal to its two senators plus the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives. D.C. has no representation in the Senate and is represented by a delegate in the House; it receives three electoral votes. More detail is provided below regarding the seats and chambers at stake in this election.

President and vice president. The president and vice president are not elected directly by voters but are instead chosen by electors through the Electoral College. Candidates must be at least 35 years old, natural-born U.S. citizens, and U.S. residents for at least 14 years.

Senate. The Senate is made up of 100 members (two from each state) elected by plurality vote in multi-member constituencies to serve six-year terms. One-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. Each candidate must be at least 30 years old, have held U.S. citizenship for at least nine years, and be a resident of the state in which he or she is running.

House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, 435 members are elected by plurality vote in single-member constituencies to serve two-year terms. Every state receives at least one seat, and the rest are awarded according to the size of the population. Each member of the House must be at least 25 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and be a resident of the state in which he or she is running.

Governors. The governor of each state is its chief executive officer. The governor’s specific powers vary by state, but mandates include executing and implementing legislation; making court and administrative appointments; and approving the state’s budget and appropriations. Term limits and legal requirements to run for the office of governor vary by state. Most states limit governors to two consecutive terms of four years (Vermont and New Hampshire have terms of two years, and some states have no limit on consecutive terms served).",Elections in the United States: 2024 General Elections  The International Foundation for Electoral Systems,The International Foundation for Electoral Systems,https://www.ifes.org/tools-resources/election-snapshots/elections-united-states-2024-general-elections
"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,"Why is the US election on a Tuesday in November? What to know, in 500 words - Al Jazeera English","Americans are heading to the polls on November 5 as part of an Election Day tradition dating back to the mid-1800s.

Across Latin America, it usually falls on a Sunday. In India, it can span weeks given the country’s vast territory. And in the Middle East, Saturday is frequently the pivotal day.

But in the United States, every four years, votes for president are cast on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the month of November.

That’s right, we’re talking about Election Day.

And this year is no different: Millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 5 to vote for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or her Republican rival, Donald Trump.

Yet, despite the country’s long history of holding presidential contests in early November, what is less widely known is why or how that tradition got started.

According to historians, it is all tied to American farmers. Yes, really.

But before we get into that, you first need to know what system was in place before US presidential elections were held on a single date nationwide.

Up until the mid-1800s, election dates varied by US state, so long as they were scheduled in the weeks before the Electoral College met in December.

In 1844, for example, the presidential election was held over a one-month period between early November and early December.

Some critics said the system was inefficient and worried that holding votes on different dates could also influence the results, according to History.com.

If Americans saw that a presidential hopeful did well in an early-voting area, for example, that could lead to a better result for the candidate in other parts of the country that voted later.

So in 1845, the US Congress passed an act (PDF) to establish a uniform date to elect the president and vice president in all the states of the Union.

That date, the act states, should be “on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November”.

But why a Tuesday, and why in November? Here’s where the farmers come in.

At the time, many Americans in the fledgling country — then less than 100 years old — were involved in agriculture.

Simply put, November was chosen because it did not coincide with the busy spring planting season or the autumn harvest, and it came before cold winter temperatures set in.

Many of these early American farmers also lived in rural areas far from larger population centres where ballots were typically cast. This meant that it could take a day of travel to reach their polling place.

The day of the week for the election was also chosen by a process of elimination. Sunday was out of the question because this is when Christians attend church.

And Wednesday was typically “market day”, when farmers sold produce and other goods.

For those same reasons, Sunday and Wednesday could not be considered for travel days either — so the idea of holding the election on Monday or Thursday was nixed too.

Therefore, Tuesday was the best choice.

So there you have it. “The Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November”, explained.","Why is the US election on a Tuesday in November?

BBC

When US President Joe Biden walked through Kyiv in February 2023 on a surprise visit to show solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, air sirens were wailing. “I felt something… more strongly than ever before,” he later recalled. “America is a beacon to the world.” The world now waits to see who takes charge of this self-styled beacon after Americans make their choice in next week’s presidential election. Will Kamala Harris carry on in Biden’s footsteps with her conviction that in “these unsettled times, it is clear America cannot retreat”? Or will it be Donald Trump with his hope that “Americanism, not globalism” will lead the way? We live in a world where the value of US global influence is under question. Regional powers are going their own way, autocratic regimes are making their own alliances, and the devastating wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere are raising uncomfortable questions about the value of Washington’s role. But America matters by dint of its economic and military strength, and its major role in many alliances. I turned to some informed observers for their reflections on the global consequences of this very consequential election.

Military might

“I cannot sugarcoat these warnings,” says Rose Gottemoeller, Nato’s former deputy secretary general. “Donald Trump is Europe’s nightmare, with echoes of his threat to withdraw from Nato in everyone’s ears.” Washington’s defence spending amounts to two-thirds of the military budgets of Nato’s 31 other members. Beyond Nato, the US spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia. Trump boasts he’s playing hardball to force other Nato countries to meet their spending targets, which is 2% of their GDP - only 23 of the member nations have hit this target in 2024. But his erratic statements still jar. If Harris wins, Ms Gottemoeller believes “Nato will no doubt be in good Washington hands.” But she has a warning there too. “She will be ready to continue working with Nato and the European Union to achieve victory in Ukraine, but she will not back off on [spending] pressure on Europe.”

But Harris’s team in the White House will have to govern with the Senate or the House, which could both soon be in Republican hands, and will be less inclined to back foreign wars than their Democratic counterparts. There’s a growing sense that no matter who becomes president, pressure will mount on Kyiv to find ways out of this war as US lawmakers become increasingly reluctant to pass huge aid packages. Whatever happens, Ms Gottemoeller says, “I do not believe that Nato must fall apart.” Europe will need to “step forward to lead.”

The peacemaker?

The next US president will have to work in a world confronting its greatest risk of major power confrontation since the Cold War. “The US remains the most consequential international actor in matters of peace and security”, Comfort Ero, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, tells me. She adds a caveat, “but its power to help resolve conflicts is diminished.” Wars are becoming ever harder to end. “Deadly conflict is becoming more intractable, with big-power competition accelerating and middle powers on the rise,” is how Ms Ero describes the landscape. Wars like Ukraine pull in multiple powers, and conflagrations such as Sudan pit regional players with competing interests against each other, and some more invested in war than in peace. America is losing the moral high ground, Ms Ero says. “Global actors notice that it applies one standard to Russia's actions in Ukraine, and another to Israel's in Gaza. The war in Sudan has seen terrible atrocities but gets treated as a second-tier issue.” A win by Harris, she says, “represents continuity with the current administration.” If it’s Trump, he “might give Israel an even freer hand in Gaza and elsewhere, and has intimated he could try to cut a Ukraine deal with Moscow over Kyiv’s head.” On the Middle East, the Democratic candidate has repeatedly echoed Mr Biden’s firm backing of Israel’s “right to defend itself.” But she’s also made a point of emphasising that “the killing of innocent Palestinians has to stop.”

Palestinians sit next to a fire in the rubble of their destroyed home in Khan Younis

Trump has also declared it’s time to “get back to peace and stop killing people.” But he’s reportedly told the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what you have to do.” The Republican contender prides himself on being a peacemaker. “I will have peace in the Middle East, and soon,” he vowed in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya TV on Sunday night. He’s promised to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords. These bilateral agreements normalised relations between Israel and a few Arab states, but were widely seen to have sidelined the Palestinians and ultimately contributed to the current unprecedented crisis. On Ukraine, Trump never hides his admiration for strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He’s made it clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine, and with it the US’s hefty military and financial support. “I’ll get out. We gotta get out,” he insisted in a recent rally.

Harris has pledged to be a firm ally to Ukraine

In contrast, Harris has said: “I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine. And I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war.” But Ms Ero worries that, no matter who’s elected, things could get worse in the world.

Business with Beijing

“The biggest shock to the global economy for decades.” That’s the view of leading China scholar Rana Mitter regarding Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariffs on all imported Chinese goods. Imposing steep costs on China, and many other trading partners, has been one of Trump’s most persistent threats in his “America first” approach. But Trump also lauds what he sees as his own strong personal connection with President Xi Jinping. He told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board he wouldn’t have to use military force if Beijing moved to blockade Taiwan because the Chinese leader “respects me and he knows I’m [expletive] crazy.” But both leading Republicans and Democrats are hawkish. Both see Beijing as being bent on trying to eclipse America as the most consequential power. But Mr Mitter, a British historian who holds the ST Lee Chair in US-Asia relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School, sees some differences. With Ms Harris he says, “relations would likely develop in a linear fashion from where they are now.” If Trump wins, it’s a more “fluid scenario.” For example, on Taiwan, Mr Mitter points to Trump’s ambivalence about whether he would come to the defence of an island far from America. China’s leaders believe both Harris and Trump will be tough. Mr Mitter sees it as “a small group of establishment types favour Harris as ‘better the opponent you know.’ A significant minority see Trump as a businessman whose unpredictability might just mean a grand bargain with China, however unlikely that seems.”

Climate crisis

“The US election is hugely consequential not just for its citizens but for the whole world because of the pressing imperative of the climate and nature crisis,” says Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. “Every fraction of a degree matters to avert the worst impacts of climate change and prevent a future where devastating hurricanes like Milton are the norm,” she added.

An extreme heat warning in Death Valley, California

But as Hurricanes Milton and Helene raged, Trump derided environmental plans and policies to confront this climate emergency as “one of the greatest scams of all time.” Many expect him to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement as he did in his first term. However, Ms Robinson believes Trump cannot stop the momentum now gathering steam. “He cannot halt the US energy transition and roll back the billions of dollars in green subsidies... nor can he stop the indefatigable non-federal climate movement.” She also urged Harris, who still hasn’t fleshed out her own stance, to step up “to show leadership, build on the momentum of recent years, and spur other major emitters to pick up the pace.”

Humanitarian leadership

“The outcome of the US election holds immense significance, given the unparalleled influence the United States wields, not just through its military and economic might, but through its potential to lead with moral authority on the global stage,” says Martin Griffiths, a veteran conflict mediator, who, until recently, was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. He sees greater light if Harris wins, and says that “a return to Trump’s presidency marked by isolationism and unilateralism, offers little but a deepening of global instability.” But he has criticism, too, for the Biden-Harris administration, citing its “hesitancy” over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. Aid agency bosses have repeatedly condemned Hamas’s murderous October 7th assault on Israeli civilians. But they’ve also repeatedly called on the US to do much more to end the profound suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as in Lebanon.

A billboard in Tehran shows the Iranian president and a Revolutionary Guards leader opposite Biden and Netanyahu

Biden and his top officials continually called for more aid to flow into Gaza, and did make a difference at times. But critics say the aid, and the pressure, was never enough. A recent warning that some vital military assistance could be cut pushed the decision until after the US elections. The US is the single largest donor when it comes to the UN system. In 2022, it provided a record $18.1bn (£13.9bn). But in Trump’s first term, he axed funding for several UN agencies and pulled out of the World Health Organisation. Other donors scrambled to fill the gaps – which is what Trump wanted to happen. But Griffths still believes America is an indispensable power. “In a time of global conflict and uncertainty, the world longs for the US to rise to the challenge of responsible, principled leadership... We demand more. We deserve more. And we dare to hope for more.”",How this US election could change state of the world  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl490zrz45o

Fri, 01st Nov 2024

The US election is a pivotal event, with wide-ranging implications for the US and global economies. We believe that the closely fought contest between the current Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former Republican president, Donald Trump, is a toss-up. We have been exploring the implications of the contest for the US and globally in our “US election: its impact on…” series captured under our US 2024 elections theme. Our key views are summarised below.

Impact on the US economy, policy and business sectors

We see some divergence in US macroeconomic outcomes under the rival presidencies. In both cases, we still expect the US economy to remain fundamentally strong. However, under Mr Trump we would expect slightly weaker economic growth, higher inflation and a wider fiscal deficit than under Ms Harris. Consequently, we would expect a less smooth path to lower US interest rates under Mr Trump than under his rival, and probably a stronger US dollar as a result. The divergence mainly relates to likely differences in approach to trade, immigration and taxes.

Trade: Ms Harris would retain a protectionist tilt in US trade policy, with a primary focus on China. Mr Trump’s administration would seek broad application of tariffs and, although pushback from US businesses and trading partners will result in a watering down of proposals, we expect executive orders to force the adoption of some higher rates. These tariffs would increase prices for US consumers and also affect US exports as other economies respond with countermeasures.

These tariffs would increase prices for US consumers and also affect US exports as other economies respond with countermeasures. Immigration: policy towards immigration will tighten under either candidate, but Ms Harris would probably favour enhancing legal migration pathways, whereas Mr Trump would prioritise limiting immigration across the board. We see greater risk of labour market disruption and tightening under Mr Trump, with the effect of applying firmer upward pressure on prices.

We see greater risk of labour market disruption and tightening under Mr Trump, with the effect of applying firmer upward pressure on prices. Tax: neither candidate is anxious about the wide US fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, with Ms Harris’s plans to raise revenue through higher corporation taxes and the phasing out of personal income tax cuts, the shortfall is likely to be narrower. Mr Trump hopes to make those tax cuts permanent, and although deregulation is a major campaign theme, he has not been drawn on specific offsetting spending cuts.

Competition with China drives bipartisan consensus on some, but not all, domestic industrial and sectoral policies. Industrial policy and re- (or near-) shoring aspirations will remain central themes under either presidency, driven by competition with China. Mr Trump would probably tweak support for clean energy but maintain subsidies for semiconductors and technology; Ms Harris would largely continue current policies. Under either presidency, we expect that major domestic legislation will struggle to make its way through what we think is likely to be a divided Congress. Still, through executive actions and other measures, there will be scope to influence outcomes, and we expect some of the following sectoral impacts.

Automotive: Ms Harris would focus on reducing vehicle emissions by tightening fuel economy standards, encouraging electric vehicle (EV) adoption and boosting investment in US manufacturing of EVs, semiconductors and batteries. Mr Trump would pull back goals for reducing vehicle emissions, and his anti-China stance could slow the shift towards EVs.

Mr Trump would pull back goals for reducing vehicle emissions, and his anti-China stance could slow the shift towards EVs. Consumer goods and retail: A Harris victory would continue an anti-trust approach to regulation, ensuring continuing scrutiny on businesses to keep prices low for consumers. A Trump victory would probably lead to a more pro-business regulatory stance, but his tariff and immigration policies would cause disruption for many firms.

A Trump victory would probably lead to a more pro-business regulatory stance, but his tariff and immigration policies would cause disruption for many firms. Energy: Ms Harris would continue with energy transition policies, meaning prioritising the fight against climate change and supporting the adoption of renewable energies, to meet the existing target of having an emission-free power sector by 2035. A Trump administration would weaken environmental regulation and reduce subsidies for renewable energy, while removing barriers to oil and gas production.

Financial services: a Harris administration would aim to align the US with global standards and remain vigilant about speculative, abusive or anti-competitive activities. Mr Trump would pursue softer rules for banks and other financial firms, including in cryptocurrency, and appoint more industry-friendly administrators.

Mr Trump would pursue softer rules for banks and other financial firms, including in cryptocurrency, and appoint more industry-friendly administrators. Healthcare: Ms Harris would focus on risk-pooling and expanding access to healthcare, supported by increasing centralisation of the system. For Mr Trump, the priorities are consumer choice and transparency, with many decisions likely to be left to individual states, courts and providers. Ms Harris would seek to protect reproductive rights, in contrast to Mr Trump’s preference for enforcing state-level restrictions.

Ms Harris would seek to protect reproductive rights, in contrast to Mr Trump’s preference for enforcing state-level restrictions. Technology: Mr Trump would probably be more hands-off than Ms Harris on competition and artificial intelligence, but stricter restrictions on immigration could affect recruitment in the tech sector.

US foreign policy would move in an isolationist direction under Mr Trump, but would retain a more traditional bearing under Ms Harris. Mr Trump’s “America-first” agenda would inject uncertainty into key US alliances and partnerships, especially on issues such as defence spending, trade imbalances and China ties. However, his more radical proposals, such as US withdrawal from NATO, are best seen as low-probability risks. Ms Harris would apply pressure on similar issues, but in the context of fuller support for long-standing relationships in Asia and Europe. There would be less US support for multilateral organisations under Mr Trump, and he would probably pull the US out of international climate negotiations. A Trump administration would focus more on “hard” power accumulation through higher defence spending to further US interests, whereas a Harris administration would retain “soft” power tools such as development and aid spending.

Impact on the global economy and geopolitics

The US election will have economic and geopolitical implications for the rest of the world. Given the higher level of discontinuity that we anticipate under Mr Trump, we explored some of the exposures for other geographies in the Trump Risk Index. This highlighted the vulnerability of US allies and major trading partners to shifts in US trade and security policy.

We have also explored specific regional outcomes under both presidencies.

Africa: Both candidates would seek to combat the geostrategic and commercial influence of China and Russia in Africa. Ms Harris would commit more to initiatives that support pan-African institutions, the region’s wider development agenda and the drive for greater regional economic integration. Mr Trump would focus on securing influence over strategic partners in Africa and access to their natural resources

Asia: US security alliances in East Asia would hold under either Ms Harris or Mr Trump, but demands on allies would rise notably under Mr Trump. The China-linked supply chains of South-east Asian economies would come under similar scrutiny, with punitive actions more likely under Mr Trump. A stronger US dollar under Mr Trump would reignite balance-of-payment pressures for some Asian economies.

China: US-China economic disentanglement under Mr Trump would be more intense and broad-based than under Ms Harris, spreading across a wider subset of industries and areas of co-operation. A more confrontational period with the US would accelerate China’s efforts to stabilise its ties with US allies and improve those with non-Western countries.

Europe: We would expect more intense US pressure on European defence spending levels under Mr Trump than Ms Harris, and also a faster reduction in US aid for Ukraine. A blanket tariff on EU exports to the US would represent a major shock to the European economy, notably that of Germany, and one that we anticipate would elicit a countervailing response from the EU.

Latin America: Under Mr Trump, the region would probably face slower economic growth, higher inflation, steeper borrowing costs and more complicated foreign relations, especially regarding China. The regional outlook would be more benign under Ms Harris, although we would still expect some tightening of US policies on immigration and China ties.

Middle East: The US will remain militarily engaged in the Middle East regardless of the presidential election outcome. Both Ms Harris and Mr Trump are pressuring Israel to cease military action in Gaza and Lebanon. Mr Trump is more likely to align with right-wing Israeli policies, whereas Ms Harris may advocate for a two-state solution. Under either administration, Israel will continue to be a key US ally, driven by security concerns in the region, notably Iran.

Weaker US growth and the likely intensification of global trade conflicts point to a more challenging global growth outlook under Mr Trump than Ms Harris. Our analysis suggests that, among major markets, growth prospects would be among the most affected for China, Germany and Mexico under Mr Trump. The likelihood of higher US interest rates and a stronger US dollar would also extend local currency strains for some markets and complicate efforts to support local growth through monetary policy easing.

"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,US elections in a new phase - CaixaBank Research,"This eventful election year, with over half of the world’s population being called to the polls, will soon culminate with the US presidential elections on 5 November, which will also see one third of the Senate and the entire House of Representatives being up for re-election. The various possible combinations of results which will emerge from the nation’s checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches of the world’s leading economic power are particularly significant on this occasion. This is the case both due to the economic and geopolitical challenges that lie ahead and because of the antagonistic nature of the candidates’ profiles and programmes, as this increases the uncertainty surrounding what path economic and foreign policy will take over the next four years. Moreover, the contest is likely to be decided in just a handful of swing-state counties, with the consequent risk of challenges, vote recounts and delays in the final result that this entails.

The starting point is an American economy which, having overcome the post-COVID inflationary phase and the period dominated by the decisive monetary policy response that followed, is losing steam now that the pent-up savings from the pandemic have evaporated and the effects of the monetary tightening are beginning to be felt in the labour market. In particular, there are still significant macroeconomic imbalances, both on the monetary side (inflation) despite the progress of the last 12 months and, above all, on the fiscal side, with a structural budget deficit of around 6% of GDP and public debt set to exceed 130% of GDP by the end of the decade. This is a reflection of the public spending and investment programmes approved since the pandemic, as well as the ongoing poor performance of tax revenues for a developed country (30% of GDP). The need for a medium-term budget consolidation programme clashes with both candidates’ intentions, given that neither of them appear willing to break the current fiscal inertia, preferring instead to focus on either social spending and the energy and infrastructure transition (Kamala Harris) or tax cuts (Donald Trump). Therefore, the first conclusion we can draw is that fiscal policy will continue to show a clearly expansionary tone, regardless of who wins. This will increase the Treasury’s already high funding needs, which in turn could drive up global interest rates and hinder the monetary policy normalisation process.

On the supply side, the differences are more substantial. The tightening of immigration controls in the event of a Republican victory could lead to a halt of the sharp rise in the labour force which we have seen in the last two years (+2.4% or 4 million people), 40% of which corresponds to foreign workers, and which has helped to narrow the huge gap between the supply and demand for labour seen in March 2022 (when there were two vacancies for every job seeker). In the sphere of trade, meanwhile, Trump will increase trade barriers regardless of whether the affected countries are allies (10% universal tariff) or not (60% minimum for products manufactured in China), and there are doubts over whether this could impact the USMCA, especially in the case of cars produced in Mexico with Chinese capital. In the case of Harris, the supply policies will entail a continuation of those seen in recent years: no noticeable changes in tariffs, a commitment to clean energy, bolstering competition policies and seeking a controlled de-risking process. All of this is normal during a campaign, but if we put all the promises on the table, the movement of the supply and demand curves would lead us to an equilibrium point with higher inflation, but not much more growth. The reality will no doubt be different and bond vigilantes can also do their job, but at the very least we should expect more instability in the financial markets in the short term. A risk scenario with a Republican sweep (Trump victory and Republican control of both houses) could lead us down a path towards a more closed economy with greater imbalances and lower potential growth, awaiting the productivity effects of AI.

In the geopolitical sphere, the multiple ongoing wars, structural changes in the globalisation process, the widespread search for strategic autonomy and even defence policy itself could be affected by the outcome of the election. Considering that in relations with China there will be no significant differences between the candidates (and probably not many in the country’s stance on the Middle East conflict either), it is in the relationship with Europe, both in the management of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the future role that the US will play in NATO, where the outcome of the elections will not be indifferent. In short, as Adam Tooze recently reminded us, at a time when the old US economic policy is dying, the next four years will determine the shape of the new one, which makes the outcome of this election all the more important.",US elections in a new phase  CaixaBank Research,CaixaBank Research,https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/recent-developments/us-elections-new-phase

Middle East Policy

On the most basic level, our faculty experts predict that Middle East policy would remain constant between the two candidates. However, they agree that Trump may be more supportive of Israel and less sympathetic to the humanitarian crises in Palestine and Lebanon.

Mark Deets , assistant professor of history, expects Trump to cut back on some of the overseas assistance and aid: “Democrats generally spend more on development and Republicans on defense.” Deets explained that Harris is a “typical interventionist” who believes that American leadership is needed abroad, while Trump tends to take a “populist approach,” appealing to isolationists who believe the United States “should not be as involved in foreign affairs” with the exception of Israel.

Sean Lee , assistant professor of political science, corroborated this belief: “My suspicion is that U.S. policy would probably become less pro-Ukraine than it is right now if Trump wins the election, while the Middle East policy likely won’t change much.”

“Middle Eastern foreign policy can only move in one direction: the pro-Israel direction.”

Lee argued that, despite more humanitarian language surrounding President Joe Biden’s conduct, the Biden-Harris administration has not made an effort to enforce domestic U.S. law, much less international humanitarian law in Gaza. “Documents show that the Biden administration has gone against its own State Department experts who found that Israel is blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to maintain arms transfers to Israel. Under Trump, the situation is likely to get worse,” Lee said.

For example, it wouldn’t surprise Lee to see Trump sign off on an annexation of the West Bank based on his 2020 “peace plan” to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Likewise, “to the extent that there’s any pressure now for Israel to not maintain a permanent presence in Gaza, I wouldn’t be shocked if that goes away under a Trump administration,” he added.

In a nutshell, Lee believes that “Middle Eastern foreign policy can only move in one direction: the pro-Israel direction.” And while Deets would like to see the United States backing off from its support for Israel, he doesn’t “see it happening anytime soon, regardless of who wins.”

The Arab-American Vote

Following the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, many predict that the Arab-American vote will be a toss up. “The Biden-Harris administration has disappointed so many on its Gaza policy that a number of people are going to step back and either cast a throwaway vote or a third-party vote,” Deets said, sharing that some of these protest votes may swing in Trump’s direction.

“The feeling of abandonment by both candidates is especially true with the younger generation,” Deets added. “They’re very upset with Democrats for their support of Israel.” They’re also skeptical of Trump for his extreme support of Israel during his term and repeated use of the word ‘Palestinian’ as a slur, according to Deets.

This could be significant as Arab-Americans represent a large number of voters in certain swing states such as Michigan. “I don’t know exactly what the polls are now in Michigan, but it’s one of those states where that issue could throw the election,” said Deets. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan — home to over 200,000 Arabs — by a mere 11,000 votes.

“The Biden-Harris administration has disappointed so many on its Gaza policy that a number of people are going to step back and either cast a throwaway vote or a third-party vote.”

The protest vote has gained traction through national movements such as Uncommitted and Abandon Harris, which have been lobbying Arab-American voters. Many have turned their support to Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and other independent or third party candidates.

U.S. Domestic Policy

Alaa El Hadidi, adjunct faculty in AUC’s Prince Alwaleed Center for American Studies and Research , broke down current American voter priorities into the following: Middle East policy and human rights, China policy, the economy, migrants and the environment.

While policies can be static, El Hadidi said to watch the different attitudes between the two parties, especially with foreign policy. “They have very different approaches to the region; however, the place of the Middle East in the overall American strategic interest will remain the same.”

This extends to each party’s China policy: “One of the very few things both parties agree on is that the rise of China is a threat and that they need to rival the country’s major economic trade partnerships in the Gulf and beyond, though each candidate has their own approach.”

Domestically, El Hadidi thinks human rights will be a huge voter issue. “The last time America was so polarized was during the Vietnam War, which happened almost at the same time as the civil rights movements,” he said. Today, the issue of human rights manifests through the Middle East policy, abortion rights and the migrant issue.

On migration, El Hadidi recalled Trump’s immigration ban on eight Muslim countries. “We can expect Trump to be more stringent on immigration rules, whether from Latin America or the Middle East.” Meanwhile, a Harris administration would be more flexible on immigration and more vocal about humanitarian crises, including along the U.S.-Mexico border.

One final issue to watch is the environment. “Trump now has his famous slogan to encourage increased production of fossil fuels: ‘Drill, baby, drill.’ With the Democrats, environmental policy is a dilemma. On one hand, they want cheap oil, but on the other, they want less oil produced,” said El Hadidi, explaining that the Biden-Harris environmental policy is costly to consumers.",U.S. Elections: What to Watch  ABOUT US EDITOR'S NOTE About Us The Cairo Review of,ABOUT US EDITOR'S NOTE About Us The Cairo Review of,https://www.aucegypt.edu/news/us-elections-what-watch

"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:47:49 GMT",US elections,Transition 2025: Did Trump Win an “Unprecedented and Powerful Mandate”? - Council on Foreign Relations,"Donald Trump declared on Election Night, as votes were still being counted, that “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.” Many media outlet echoed his claim by describing his victory as a “landslide,” “resounding,” and “sweeping.” But was it?

To answer that question, consider how the winning candidate performed in three recent presidential elections. Candidate A won 52.9 percent of the popular vote, notched 365 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up eight Senate seats and twenty-one House seats. Candidate B won 51.3 percent of the popular vote, notched 306 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up three Senate seats while losing thirteen House seats. Candidate C won 49.8 percent of the popular vote, notched 312 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up four Senate seats while losing one House seat.

Those numbers suggest two possible conclusions. One is that Candidate A had the most impressive victory. The other is that none of the three candidates received a decisive mandate from the voters.

Candidate A is Barack Obama in 2008. Candidate B is Joe Biden in 2020. Candidate C is Trump in 2024.

Trump’s victory certainly pales in comparison to the landslide presidential victories of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 (60.8 percent of the popular vote and 523 electoral votes), Lyndon Johnson in 1964 (61.1 percent and 486), Richard Nixon in 1972 (60.7 percent and 520), or Ronald Reagan in 1984 (58.8 percent and 525).

Indeed, by historical standards Trump’s victory is unimpressive. Consider the following: His margin of victory in the popular vote—which will be at most 1.6 percentage points when all the votes are counted—is the fifth smallest of the thirty-two presidential races held since 1900. More people in 2024 voted for a candidate not named Trump than did. A shift of roughly 235,000 votes in the right combination in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would have elected Harris. And while Trump increased his vote total by 2.7 million in 2024 compared to 2020, he still fell more than four million short of the number that Biden won four years ago.

That Trump exaggerated his victory is no sin. All winning candidates—not just those who habitually oversell their achievements—tout their triumphs. After all, election mandates are what you make of them.

Trump’s cabinet picks suggest that he will govern as if his performance matched those of FDR, LBJ, Nixon, and Reagan. Perhaps he will succeed in solving America’s problems as he has vowed, thereby earning more freedom to enact his ambitious agenda.

The Obama and Biden presidencies, however, suggest that Trump’s mandate is not as powerful as he thinks. Both Democrats began their presidencies with the political winds at their back. Yet, their decisions in office met opposition and their popularity steadily fell. Both then saw their party lose control of the House for the second half of their term, derailing their policy agendas.

Much the same could happen to Trump, perhaps even more quickly. He seems intent on changing almost everything about the U.S. government. But disruptions exact a political price that fellow Republicans may not be willing to pay. Matt Gaetz’s withdrawal from consideration to be attorney general in the face of likely Senate opposition offers an early case in point.

Beyond that, Trump won primarily because the election was a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration—a framing that the Trump campaign team worked hard to establish. Voters did not necessarily embrace Trump or his policy agenda, which left most details to the imagination. Election exit polls found that he had a favorability rating of just 48 percent. Forty-four percent of voters had a very unfavorable view, suggesting that he has a limited political upside.

Trump is also inheriting a robust economy, even if many voters think otherwise. That economic success is easier to derail than it is to sustain. Trump’s plans for mass deportations, tariffs, and massive deficit spending could send the economy into reverse. Election 2024 showed that American politics has at least one iron law: Voters punish the governing party when they believe the economy is faltering.

Finally, Trump faces one other looming liability: He is a lame duck. While he towers over American politics for now, Election 2028 will eventually exert its gravitational pull. Trump cannot run for a third term. (And no, the Twenty-Second Amendment will not be repealed.) Leading Republicans at some point will worry less about how to please Trump and more about how to advance their own presidential ambitions.

None of this is to say that Trump’s second term will be inconsequential. Far from it. He can and likely will change U.S. policy in profound and perhaps irreversible ways. But the real lesson of Election 2024 is that America remains deeply divided politically even as it produced a clear winner. So rather than ushering in a new era in American politics, the political winds that now favor Trump could easily turn against him.

The Vote

Seventeen days after Election Day, votes continue to be counted in some races—and in a few cases, recounted. As of this morning, three House races have yet to be called. Two of those races are in California, the other is in Iowa. The margins in all three races are less than a thousand votes. If the candidates currently leading each race win, Republicans will have 221 seats in the new House and Democrats 214.

All the Senate races have now been settled. Last night, Pennsylvania’s incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey conceded his race to Republican challenger Dave McCormick. The race had been called for McCormick two weeks ago with thousands of votes still to be counted. Casey hoped, however, that in a race in which he trailed by less than 17,000 votes out of the nearly 6.8 million cast, that he might pull out a miraculous, come-from-behind victory. Pennsylvania began an automatic vote recount earlier this week, but Casey ultimately acknowledged that the recount would likely change only a few hundred votes.

What Trump Is Saying

Trump said little in public this week about foreign policy. He did use a Truth Social post to confirm that he plans to declare a national emergency over illegal immigration and use the U.S. military to implement his plans for mass deportations.

Trump also used his announcement of Chris Wright to be secretary of energy to declare that he plans to “drive U.S. Energy Dominance, which will drive down inflation, win the A.I. arms race with China (and others), and expand American Diplomatic Power to end Wars all across the World.” The last few words hardly sound like isolationism.

What the Biden Administration Is Doing

Biden has reversed course in recent weeks on several long-standing aspects of his policy toward Ukraine. Two weeks ago, he agreed to allow U.S. military contractors to operate in Ukraine. This week he agreed to send anti-personnel mines to the country, and perhaps more importantly, authorized Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles against targets in Russia. The Biden administration argued that the changing military situation on the ground necessitated the changes in what had been longstanding policy. Trump so far has said nothing about these moves. However, several of his allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., accused Biden of trying to box in his successor at the risk of starting “World War III.”

Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Lima, Peru, on the margins of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The two leaders called for cooperation on critical issues like artificial intelligence and nuclear weapons. They did not, however, strike any significant agreements. Xi did say that he is “ready to work with the next U.S. administration” and urged the United States to make a “wise choice and keep relations stable.”

The Biden administration vetoed a UN Security Council resolution this week calling for a ceasefire in Gaza because the resolution failed to link the ceasefire to the release of hostages that Hamas holds. The administration also sent a special envoy to Beirut to try to negotiate a ceasefire in southern Lebanon and sanctioned an Israeli company that the State Department called “the largest organization involved in settlement and illegal outpost development in the West Bank.”

Trump’s Appointments

Trump named Matthew Whitaker to be the U.S. ambassador to NATO. He served as acting attorney general in the first Trump administration and was rumored to be a candidate for that position in the second Trump administration. Like many of the people Trump has named to his national security team, Whitaker brings no significant foreign-policy experience to the job. A lawyer by trade, he has worked primarily on domestic law enforcement matters.

Trump named former Republican Representative Pete Hoekstra of Michigan to be ambassador to Canada. Hoekstra does have significant foreign-policy experience. Besides serving in the U.S. House for eighteen years, including three years as chair the House Intelligence Committee, he was U.S. ambassador to The Netherlands, his native country, during the first Trump administration.

What the Pundits Are Writing

The Washington Post reported that Trump continues to ignore the traditional transition process. Among other things, “Trump has yet to collaborate with the General Services Administration, which is tasked with the complex work of handing over control of hundreds of agencies, because he has not turned in required pledges to follow ethics rules. His transition teams have yet to set foot inside a single federal office.”

Derek Grossman argued in Foreign Policy that Trump might give China a run for its money in southeast Asia. In Grossman’s view, the region will applaud “Trump’s likely deprioritizing of promoting values—such as democracy and human rights—abroad in favor of a more transactional approach that strictly aims at achieving U.S. national interests, especially among authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes that comprise most Southeast Asian states. Overall, Trump’s likely policies could put the United States in a better position to compete long-term against China in the region.”

Ana Swanson and Edward Wong asked in the New York Times whether Trump shares the hawkish assessment that his foreign-policy team has of China. They suggest perhaps not: “When it comes to China, Mr. Trump is more transactional than ideological, willing to threaten or impose punishing tariffs to try to land deals that he says will benefit the United States. He has rarely expressed support for human rights and talks of autocrats, including Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in glowing terms. And current close advisers of his, notably Elon Musk, the tycoon who owns Tesla, have important business interests in China.”

Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, argued in Time Magazine that Trump will shake up the world order. In Dalio’s view, Trump will bring about “the end of an era led by the United States, in which countries tried to work out together how to be with each other through multinational organizations with guiding principles and rules, and into a more self-interested, law-of-the-jungle-type order with the United States being one of the two biggest players and China the other— and the fight being largely the classic one of capitalism versus communism (in their contemporary versions).”

The AP’s Joshua Goodman wrote that Marco Rubio will likely reshape U.S. policy toward Latin America should the Senate confirm him as secretary of state. In Goodman’s view, Rubio “is likely to end the neglect” of the region. “But Rubio’s reputation as a national security hawk, embrace of Trump’s plan for mass deportation of migrants and knack for polarizing rhetoric is likely to alienate even some U.S. allies in the region unwilling to fall in line with the incoming president’s America First foreign policy.” Readers with long memories might recall that several recent U.S. administrations, including the Biden administration, came to office pledging to make Latin American a priority and then failed to do so.

Politico’s Adam Cancyrn assessed the Biden administration’s efforts to institutionalize its foreign policy accomplishments. Cancyrn summarized the questionable effectiveness of that strategy with a quote from Ivo Daalder, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO: “There just isn’t anything Biden can do today that isn’t reversible in ten weeks.”

My colleague Edward Alden reviewed Trump’s plans to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. Ted notes that Trump did not match his harsh words on migration during his first term with equivalent actions; he actually ordered fewer deportations than Obama did during his first term. But if Trump does make good on his current promises, Ted argues that “it will reshape migration for a generation or longer—not just in the United States but in much of the world.”

But one group of voters with the potential to affect the outcome is less likely to show up at the ballot box: those between the ages of 18 and 29.

In 2016, 90% of young Americans reported an interest in politics and 80% intended to vote, but only 43% did so, John Holbein, associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA’s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, noted in his 2020 book, “Making Young Voters: Converting Civic Attitudes into Civic Action.”

Q. Since the “youth vote” became a thing in 1972, both major parties have made considerable efforts to win over 18- to 29-year-old voters. How large of a voting bloc is that group, and could it be a major influence in a national election?

A. According to some estimates, Generation Z makes up approximately 20% of the U.S. population. Recent population estimates suggest that more than 30 million Gen Z citizens will have an opportunity to cast a ballot in 2024.

Millennials now are the largest demographic group in the United States, having just surpassed Boomers in 2020. That’s enough voters to sway the election. The open question is, “Will young voters actually show up and cast a ballot?” History suggests not, given that low rates of youth voter turnout are the norm.

Q. Why has the youth demographic not turned out in significant numbers for most U.S. elections? Do other countries have similar turnouts among younger voters?

A. Youth voter turnout is distinctly low in the United States. The “age gap” in turnout rates between old and young voters is the largest in the United States when one compares to other (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. There probably are myriad reasons for this gap, including – but not limited to – the registration barriers that are unique to the United States.

Q. Are there programs or efforts that are effective at turning out more youthful voters?

A. My research showsthat young people are especially sensitive to how difficult it is to register to vote. Reforms that make registering easier, like same-day registration and preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds, have been shown to be especially effective at raising youth voter turnout.

Q. How would a stronger youth vote likely affect an election?

A. Young people skew heavily Democratic. Youth report voting for Democrats at a 2-to-1 margin. Youth turnout could be the difference between a Democrat winning or losing. That being said, it should be acknowledged that many marginal young voters are Republicans.",Q&A: Why Doesn’t the Largest Voting Bloc in the US Turn Out?

"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,Will the US election end in political chaos? - Economist Intelligence Unit,"Will the US election end in political chaos?

Fri, 01st Nov 2024

A deadlock in the polls, election scepticism, polarisation and recent political violence have all set the stage for a chaotic ending to the US presidential election on November 5th.

Regardless of who wins, we expect it to be a close race and that the result will be contested, raising the risk of political instability and violence.

A decisive victory for either candidate via a sweep of the battleground states would facilitate a smoother transfer of power, although we assign a lower probability to this scenario.

We believe the least likely is a tie in the Electoral College vote, which would yield a contentious and drawn-out process of Congress selecting the winner.

With the polls in deadlock and election scepticism rising again, a disorderly and contentious ending to the US presidential election remains a very real possibility. Intense polarisation means that nearly half of US voters will probably be dissatisfied with the election result when their preferred candidate loses. Those feelings could translate into violence, with the 2021 assault on the US Capitol and a spate of recent attacks on political figures serving as alarming precedents. This article outlines three scenarios for how we expect the immediate aftermath of the presidential election to play out.

A close result is contested, raising risks of political instability and violence (70% probability)

We assume that the election will be decided by a handful of battleground states, where the margins of victory will be extremely slim. This occurred in the 2020 presidential election, when margins of less than 1 point determined the electoral vote in three of the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. The margins in the remaining battleground states (Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) were not much higher, between 1 and 3 points. A similar result appears likely this year. The Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the Republican former president, Donald Trump, remain locked in a statistical tie in these states, and polling trends suggest that this will not change before Election Day.

Tight battleground-state races and delays in vote counting, which we believe are inevitable, mean that there is unlikely to be a clear winner on Election Day. Mail-in ballots, which traditionally skew Democrat and could prove decisive in the most competitive races, pose particular challenges. Pennsylvania, which has the most electoral votes of any battleground state, will not start processing mail-in ballots until Election Day, according to state law; the same is true of Wisconsin. However, delays are likely even in states where early processing is legal, owing to the time required to count these ballots and any other state regulations that could slow the process further. Arizona, for example, allows voters to mail ballots as late as Election Day, making it unlikely that these votes will be counted until well after the polls close. Any ambiguity around the election result will spark voter distrust and conspiracy theories, as occurred in 2020, particularly if vote counting drags on for days (if not weeks), which is possible. Tensions and uncertainty will rise further if Mr Trump declares himself the winner prematurely, as he did in 2020 before ultimately losing, which we expect him to do again. Online disinformation, which remains problemic, will create additional confusion.

Should Mr Trump lose the election, we expect that he would challenge the result, with disruptive and potentially violent consequences. He has repeatedly stated that only voter fraud could cause him to lose, laying the foundation for Republican voters and lawmakers to question a win by Ms Harris even before the election happens. He and his affiliates have also filed more than 100 lawsuits in the battleground states to challenge a potential loss pre-emptively, citing baseless claims, including over non-citizens voting. Legal challenges, which we expect would be unsuccessful, could still delay the process of states and Congress certifying the results by their respective December and early January deadlines. However, we believe it unlikely that this would prohibit Ms Harris from taking office by Inauguration Day in late January, given that recent laws and legal precedent have substantially narrowed the prospects for state officials, Congress and judges (including the US Supreme Court) to challenge and overturn election results. A more likely outcome is that Mr Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud prompt protests by his supporters in state capitals and Washington DC, which could turn violent. However, we believe that the risk of a large-scale incident is limited, in part owing to better preparedness by police and security officials. Regardless, we would not expect Mr Trump to attend Ms Harris’s inauguration, which would keep political tensions and voter distrust elevated during her presidency.

A narrow election loss for Ms Harris could prompt Democrats to challenge the results, but only if there is a clear and credible pretext, which we do not consider likely. Destruction of ballot boxes, as occurred recently in Oregon and Washington, or voter intimidation at polling stations, which remains a risk, could provide grounds for a legal challenge. However, neither of these irregularities are likely to be pervasive, limiting the prospects for Democrats to pursue legal recourse for these reasons. A more likely scenario is that Democrats request a vote recount in battleground states with extremely tight results. However, state rules would prevent this from disrupting election certification timelines, and we would not expect Ms Harris to push for further action if a recount confirmed the original result, as usually happens. We would expect that Democratic leaders, including Ms Harris, would accept the certified results and that she would attend Mr Trump’s inauguration, in line with tradition. This would encourage Democratic protests, which would be likely after a Trump win, to stay peaceful. However, the risks of violent demonstrations would rise if Mr Trump were to impose draconian restrictions on civil rights, women’s healthcare rights, LGBT+ rights and immigrant rights, as he has threatened to do.

Clear election win facilitates smooth transition of power (25% probability)

Although unlikely, it remains possible that the election’s winner will sweep the battleground states by large margins. This would contradict recent polling trends, but could happen if pollsters undercount support for the winning candidate or if undecided voters move disproportionately in a single direction. A decisive victory would make it difficult for the losing side to challenge the result, particularly in a way that jeopardises the certification process. We would expect Ms Harris to accept such a loss immediately. Mr Trump would still probably challenge such a result if he loses. However, we would expect his election denial claims to lack credibility, even in the eyes of his supporters, discouraging large-scale protests, particularly violent ones.

Tied electoral vote leads to a protracted and contentious winner-selection process (5% probability)

A tie in the Electoral College vote, which is our least likely scenario, would be the most disruptive outcome. Such a result lacks recent precedent, having occurred only once in US history, in 1824. Although very unlikely, this could hypothetically occur if the election results radically depart from recent polling trends, for example if third-party candidates outperform or non-battleground states flip unexpectedly.

In this situation, the US constitution dictates that the incoming House of Representatives (the lower house) and Senate (the upper house) vote to choose the president and vice-president respectively. Our baseline assumption that the next Congress will be divided, with Democrats retaking the House and Republicans winning back the Senate, both by thin margins, would present a possibility of Congress pairing Ms Harris with Mr Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance. Such an outcome would be highly controversial, if not entirely unworkable amid a highly polarised political climate. However, other scenarios are also possible, particularly as a surprise Electoral College tie could mean that the congressional elections yield different results than we expect. Special voting rules in the House, whereby the presidential vote occurs via state delegations rather than voting among the 435 House members, creates additional uncertainties. Regardless of how the vote plays out, we would expect the result to be highly contentious, sparking partisan resentment, voter dissatisfaction and potentially political and social unrest.

"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:02:10 GMT",US elections,The dollar and global markets after the US election - Brookings Institution,"Sections Print

The U.S. dollar has risen moderately in the weeks since Donald Trump won the presidential election, in an almost exact repeat of price action after the 2016 election. The dollar rise reflects primarily expectations for fiscal easing and higher growth and still has room to run, based on how modestly interest differentials have moved compared to 2016. A second, much larger phase of dollar strength is likely to come if the U.S. imposes tariffs on China. The lesson from similar tariffs in 2018 is that China allows the yuan to fall as an almost one-for-one offset to the hit to competitiveness. Such a fall is likely to put severe depreciation pressure on the rest of emerging markets, in addition to pulling down commodity prices. Such a tightening in global financial conditions raises the risk of negative spillback to the U.S., which—from China’s perspective—is probably not unwelcome. Global markets after the US election In the days following the election, U.S. equities rose very sharply. We compare the rise in the S&P 500 in the days following November 5 to what happened in 2016 (Figure 1). Stocks rose much more sharply than back then, potentially on expectations of deregulation, but—as time passed—the dollar began to outperform (Figure 2), perhaps a sign markets are starting to assign some odds to U.S. tariffs (which could be growth negative—thereby weighing on the S&P 500—but lift the dollar).

Interest rate differentials of the U.S. vis-à-vis other advanced economies are one way to benchmark the dollar rise. Now as in 2016, expectations of fiscal easing and higher growth are lifting U.S. interest rates versus elsewhere. We compare the move in the 2y2y (Figure 3) and 5y5y (Figure 4) forward rate differential since November 5 (blue) versus what happened in 2016 (black). So far, markets have only lifted the U.S. rate differential around half of what they did in 2016, which means that this source of dollar strength probably still has more room to run.

The impact of tariffs on global markets You can think of the current rise in the dollar—predicated primarily on expectations of fiscal easing—as the first phase of dollar strength after the election. A second, perhaps much larger phase may come if the Trump administration imposes tariffs on China. The 2018 experience is instructive in this regard. Back then, the U.S. tariffed half of all imports from China at a 25% rate for an average tariff rate of 12.5%. The yuan fell around 10% against the dollar around then (Figure 5), in what was an almost one-for-one offset for the hit to competitiveness. An across-the-board 60% tariff could necessitate a much larger fall in the yuan if China wants to protect the market share of its export sector in the U.S. Such a fall could put severe depreciation pressure on the rest of emerging markets and cause commodity prices to fall. This global tightening in financial conditions could then spill back to the U.S. and weigh on the S&P 500, which is what happened during the renminbi devaluation scare in 2015 and 2016 (Figure 6). From China’s perspective, such a spillback might not be entirely unwelcome. After all, the president-elect is often thought to see the S&P 500 as one gauge of his success, so persistent weakness like in 2015/6 could make the incoming administration less enthusiastic about tariffs.

Even in the run-up to tariffs—before they are even implemented—there could be adverse fallout for global markets. Currently, Brazil is the largest food exporter to China by a substantial margin (Figure 7). If China decides to try to head off tariffs by buying more agricultural products from the U.S., this could amount to a negative shock for Brazil as it scrambles to place its products elsewhere. The same is true for the European Union where transportation equipment is concerned. The EU is currently by far the largest exporter of motor vehicles, aircraft, trains, and ships to China (Figure 8). This could turn into a liability if China starts ordering more Boeing aircraft instead of Airbus, for example. In short, a second, more pronounced phase of dollar strength may start once the president-elect is in office and the likelihood of tariffs rises. Figure 7.

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,Takeaways after the 2024 U.S. election from three Bates politics professors - Bates News,"On Wednesday afternoon, just as Kamala Harris began her concession speech at Howard University, three Bates politics professors talked about the various outcomes and implications of Tuesday’s election — including Donald Trump’s convincing victory and a TBD Congressional victory for a Maine Democrat and Bates alumnus in Trump territory.

Professors John Baughman, Stephen Engel, and Clarisa Pérez-Armendáriz spoke with around 75 students, joined by faculty and staff, in Memorial Commons in Chase Hall.

Each professor offered brief opening remarks, followed by questions. Here are some takeaways from their observations.

And There’s More Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Tyler Austin Harper has published two post-election analyses: “What We Just Went Through Wasn’t an Election. It Was a Hostage Situation,” in The New York Times, and “Blame Biden,” in The Atlantic.

Clarisa Pérez-Armendáriz’s Opening Remarks

Pérez-Armendáriz, an associate professor of politics and member of the Program in Latin U.S. and Latinx Studies, explored how international migrants shape citizenship, political behavior, and representation in migrant-sending countries.

Here are a few takeaways from her opening comments:

High Turnout Showcased the Strength of U.S. Democracy

“It is really important to celebrate that that election happened and it was so vibrant — not just yesterday but in the weeks leading up to it. There was so much energy and mobilization and education. That is phenomenal, and it’s something that we should feel we can show the rest of the world.”

Regardless of one’s view of the outcome, Pérez-Armendáriz asks us to recognize how citizen engagement in the 2024 election proves our democracy’s vibrancy and resilience, a model to inspire other nations.

Absence of Election Violence and Fraud Claims Signals Stability

“We’re not in a position where the entire electoral system is under attack with lawsuits and allegations of fraud. Another thing that didn’t happen is widespread electoral violence.”

Pérez-Armendáriz pointed to the lack of disputes or violence as signaling a level of democratic stability that may help reinforce confidence in the U.S. electoral system.

A Window of Opportunity to Strengthen Trust in Elections

“We now have time, a window of opportunity, to really think about what we can do in two to four years to shore up trust in the electoral system by shoring up the system itself.”

While the 2024 election went smoothly, Pérez-Armendáriz sees a chance to reinforce public trust in the electoral process and strengthen it from attacks by bad actors.

Republican Dominance Reflects Party Strength, Beyond Trump

“This election signaled a mandate for the Republican Party, not specifically to Trump, particularly as it has evolved over the past eight years.”

Pérez-Armendáriz suggested that the election results represent a shift not just toward Trump but toward the Republican Party’s broader ideology and evolution over recent years. “If people keep going back to this just being Trump, Trump, Trump, they’re missing a really big thing.”

Democrats Must Reflect on Election Loss Without Disdain for Voters

“The [Democratic Party] failed to convince voters. But rather than call the people who [voted Republican] racist, sexist, uneducated — all the things we come up with — Democrats need to do some serious introspection.”

Pérez-Armendáriz asserted Democrats should approach the loss with humility and introspection rather than by disparaging voters.

The Threat of Democratic Backsliding May Come Through Party Power

Pérez-Armendáriz: “I came from Mexico. Trump is not a populist leader. He’s a leader with deep institutional power and a strong party. People talk about things like freedom of press, but we should really look at how parties take up power in a way that keeps them in power forever or for a long time.”

Pérez-Armendáriz suggested that instead of dismantling institutions, threats to democracy may emerge as entrenched party power that leverages government institutions for long-term dominance.

John Baughman’s Opening Remarks

Baughman, who is a professor of politics, specializes in U.S. politics including the development of the U.S. Congress and how members reshaped the institution in order to respond to constituent demand.

Here are a few takeaways from his opening comments:

The Election Was a Broad Anti-Incumbent Wave Driven by Economic Perceptions

“This was at least to some degree, not entirely, but at least some degree, an anti-incumbent election that seems to have been motivated by the economy.”

Baughman interpreted the results as a broad rejection of incumbents, driven in large part by public dissatisfaction with economic conditions, even if objectively the economy was relatively strong.

Voter Psychology Prioritizes Recent Experiences Over Abstractions

“We tend to respond to things that have happened recently rather than things that have happened more distantly, or things that are hypotheticals or counterfactuals or more abstract. Even after inflation got under control, people were still remembering not very far in the past this feeling of having to pay so much more than they had before.”

Baughman explained that while economic data had shown improvements, many voters focused on their day-to-day experiences, like the cost of groceries and gas, which influenced their views.

Alignments Based on Class Are Reshaping Party Coalitions

“There’s been a general shift, observed since at least 2016, of people with lower household income and less formal education shifting from the Democrats to Republicans, and, conversely, households with higher income and more formal education shifting from the Republicans to the Democrats. There now seems to be an increasing class split.”

According to Baughman, socioeconomic factors may increasingly be shaping political affiliations, as voters with lower incomes — who were traditionally Democratic supporters — show a growing preference for the Republican Party.

Claims of a “Mandate” Are a Political Tool, Not an Objective Reality

“Mandates in any objective sense are not a real thing. What presidents do is they claim a mandate when they win.”

While Trump declared that he and the Republican Party had received an “unprecedented mandate” from voters, most any claim of a mandate by a winning candidate is merely a rhetorical tool to advance a policy agenda rather than an indication of broad-based consensus.

Trump’s Policy Priorities Are Often Delegated to His Supporters

“Honestly, there aren’t that many issues that Trump is personally invested in. A lot of what we hear him talking about are these transactional relationships that he has with allies. It’s a way to reward them for support in getting them elected.”

Baughman posited that Trump’s approach to governance often involves delegating policy responsibility to allies, especially in areas he is less personally invested in. This strategy allows him to reward those who supported his campaign, such as potentially giving Robert Kennedy Jr. responsibility for health policy. Trump’s administration may focus more on utilizing these alliances for political gain rather than prioritizing specific issues himself.

Foreign Election Disruptions Highlight Persistent Challenges to Election Security

“According to the FBI, a foreign adversary, Russia, was doing this specifically to disrupt the election and to target Democratic strongholds.”

While election-day violence was minimal, foreign threats remain a concern, particularly as they target specific demographics to influence election outcomes. According to the FBI, bomb threats on Election Day appeared “to originate from Russian email domains.”

Stephen Engel’s Opening Remarks

Engel, a professor of politics and associate dean of the faculty, focuses on U.S. political development, constitutional law, and social movements, particularly LGBTQ+ socio-political and legal mobilization.

Here are a few takeaways from his opening comments:

Votes on Reproductive Rights Show Fragmented Values

“People voted to reinstate rights that they lost, and then they voted for the person who helped take those rights away.”

Engel was referring to a “confusing” paradox, where abortion rights amendments passed in seven states (and failed in three), highlighted how voters seem to support reproductive rights while simultaneously electing a president whose party has restricted reproductive rights.

The Supreme Court’s Path May Lead to a Nationwide Abortion Ban

“It’s very possible by 2026 or even 2028 we will have a 7–2 split in the Supreme Court, and it is very plausible that the court will find that abortion is wholly unconstitutional in the United States.”

With potential SCOTUS retirements of Clarence Thomas and Thomas Alito, and possibly Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor due to health issues, Engel warned that the Supreme Court could rule abortion unconstitutional across the U.S., if the 14th Amendment is read to provide protection for fetal personhood.

Anti-Trans Rhetoric Points to a Deepening Denial of Shared Humanity

“I see anti-trans panic as premised on a fundamentally troubling denial of our shared humanity.”

Anti-trans rhetoric during the presidential campaign, used to discredit Democratic priorities, reveals a deeper societal problem: a denial of the dignity and humanity of transgender individuals.

An oft-run commercial during the campaign mocked Kamala Harris’ support for gender-affirming care for individuals who are incarcerated, but “that’s actually a policy that was passed through during the Trump administration, but she got tagged with it,” Engel says.

U.S. Political Culture’s Tension Between Equality and Exclusion

Engel: “We have traditions that emphasize equality, respect, and opportunity, but we also have traditions that are deeply rooted in racism and misogyny.”

Referring to the work of scholar Rogers Smith, Engel noted that U.S. civic identity oscillates between ideals of equality and exclusion, with those latter including elements of white supremacy and male supremacy. Elections often reflect which side of this legacy the nation leans into.

Democracy Demands Defense Against Anti-Democratic Forces

“Democracy only works over time when there is fundamental agreement that the opposition will always be loyal to the U.S. Constitution. From my perspective as a constitutional lawyer and a constitutional theorist, it’s something we really need to wrestle with.”

U.S. institutions, including higher education, must defend democratic values actively; those who fundamentally oppose these principles should not have a seat at the table.

Is There a Counterweight to the Successful Conservative Legal Movement?

“This is a 50-year movement that built schools, fellowships, and organizational networks to create an infrastructure that helps to explain last night’s outcome. Where’s the counterweight to that?”

Engel was referring to research by constitutional law professor Amanda Hollis-Brusky of Pomona College (who spoke at Bates in October during the Election 2024 series) and others who have explored the rise and success of the conservative legal movement, and asking where was the countermovement.

Responses to a Student Question about LGBTQ Rights

Federalism May Offer LGBTQ Protections Amid Shifting National Policies

“Federalism will continue. And I think that’s going to be some of the space for LGBTQ rights.”

Engel suggested that state-level protections could play a crucial role in securing rights for LGBTQ communities, with states like Maine, New York, and California likely providing more robust safeguards than others. Three states removed anti-marriage-equality language from their state constitutions: California, Colorado, and Hawaii.

Unified Government Could Pose Risks for LGBTQ Health Care Access

Engel: “From a standpoint of healthcare, this is a clear vulnerability for LGBTQ communities.”

He expressed concern that a unified government could weaken protections for LGBTQ health care, pointing to potential changes in policies affecting access and affordability, which may follow from any changes to the Affordable Care Act.

Division within LGBTQ Community Could Hinder Collective Progress

“There’s a split in the LGBTQ community. Our community has a long history of throwing [some members] under the bus.”

Engel noted a divide within the LGBTQ community, and how those in the community who might fit the description as cisgender, gay, wealthy white men have not always supported transgender individuals. “I think we just need to be aware of it.”

Civil Society Organizations Remain a Critical Support for LGBTQ Rights

“There is a robust civil society of organizations around LGBTQ rights, and I believe those will be sustained and supported.”

Despite the challenges, Engel expressed hope in the ongoing support provided by civil society organizations, which continue to serve as vital resources for advocacy and protection of LGBTQ rights. “Civil society organizations are places to go for solace and support.”

Pérez-Armendáriz on Public Service Careers

The Importance of Diversity in Government and Public Service

“We need to be diverse. People need to be self-selecting into government, into public service jobs.”

Pérez-Armendáriz emphasized the need for more diverse representation in government positions, arguing that under the previous Trump administration, many students felt disconnected from the government because they didn’t see themselves reflected in it. She encouraged students to consider public service roles and not to dismiss them out of fear, stressing that diverse voices are essential to making a difference.

Responses to a Student Question about Deportation and Immigration

Immigration Reform Likely, But Not Mass Deportations

“Whatever happens with immigration, it’s going to look really different than just a presidentially driven mass deportation.”

While the Trump administration may use the bureaucracy to stall decisions, mass deportation isn’t likely to occur. Instead, she anticipates comprehensive immigration reform in the coming years, “which goes deeper than a mass deportation.” Students are wise to pay attention to the workings of the federal bureaucracy, she added.

Pérez-Armendáriz encouraged students to seek out civil society organizations for support and to prepare for potential challenges in the coming years.

Resistance Could Limit Mass Deportations

“Anything approaching mass deportation would be met with real resistance by community leaders, employers, and private actors.”

Baughman highlighted that while Trump may attempt administrative actions through executive orders, significant limits exist, especially with congressional involvement. Resistance from various sectors and bipartisan input could prevent extreme deportation measures from being implemented fully.

Response by Baughman to a Staff Question about Bates alumnus Jared Golden’s re-election

In Maine, Jared Golden ’11 is still waiting to learn if he pulled off what few Democratic Congressional candidates did this year, winning a seat in a district that voted strongly for Trump.

As of Friday afternoon, the Associated Press had not yet called the race. The result will depend on the state’s ranked-choice voting format.

Golden represents Maine’s 2nd Congressional District (basically everything Lewiston northward). In 2020, the district went for Trump by 6 percentage points, but Golden squeezed out a 2 percent win. Entering this year’s election, he was one of just five Democratic House members whose districts went to Trump in 2020.

Bates has two alumni in Congress; Rep. Ben Cline ’94 (R-Va.) easily won re-election.

Golden’s Unique Challenge in a Trump-Dominant District

“He faced more headwinds than really any other Democratic incumbent in the country. The only way he had any chance of holding onto that seat is by winning over substantial numbers of Trump voters.”

Baughman highlighted the political challenge Golden faced in a solidly pro-Trump, requiring an appeal to voters who typically lean Republican.

Democratic Party’s Strategic Focus on Golden’s Seat

“Democratic leaders in the House recognize the kind of district he’s in and the kinds of choices that he had to make.”

Golden’s seat is vital to the Democrats’ chances of retaining control of the House, said Baughman. Party leaders understood the district’s dynamics and the risks Golden took to maintain his position.

The Trump-Golden Coexistence

Baughman: “If you go around the 2nd District, you’d see yards with a Trump sign and a Golden sign every so often, and he needed that.”

Golden’s strategy was to coexist with Trump’s influence, acknowledging that his campaign needed to resonate with some of the district’s staunchly Republican voters for success.

Golden’s Risky Shift on Gun Control

“He took a huge risk in shifting his position on gun control and doing it so publicly.”

Golden’s decision to change his stance on gun control after the Lewiston mass shootings in 2023 was a key moment in his campaign, one that made him a target for Republicans but was crucial in appealing to voters who favored gun control.

Responses by Baughman and Engel to a Student Question on Voter Turnout

Harris Turned Out More Voters, But Trump Mobilized Even More

“Harris did well in turning out voters. In Georgia counties that Biden won in 2020, she had turned out 1 percent more voters than he had. The difference was Trump turned out far more in the counties that he won.”

While Harris did manage to increase voter turnout in some of the key areas Biden had won, Baughman said, Trump’s supporters, particularly in his stronghold counties, far outpaced her efforts, underscoring his broader ability to mobilize voters.

“A lot of people misunderstood the degree to which a network of Trump supporters, and I think especially the role of white evangelical churches, to mobilize people outside conventional party organizations.”

Fear and Anger Are Powerful Motivators for Voter Turnout

“Fear and anger are powerful motivators. There’s plenty of campaign election rhetoric research to bear it out. It’s a better way to motivate people to vote than messages of hope and promise.”

Baughman pointed to the effectiveness of fear and anger in rallying voters, arguing that such emotions have a stronger effect than positive messages of hope, which was a key factor in Trump’s ability to turn out voters even without traditional campaign structures.

Trump’s Victimhood Narrative Is Part of His Appeal

Engel: “Donald Trump is exceptional at playing the persecuted victim. He was able to transmogrify all of his extraordinarily legitimate trials into political persecution.”

Engel pointed out how Trump leveraged his legal troubles and framed himself as a victim of political persecution. This narrative of victimhood resonated with many voters, particularly those who feel left behind adding to the populist appeal of his rhetoric.

Harris’ Remarkable Campaign Despite Challenges

“Given what Harris was given to work with and the time that she had, she ran a remarkable campaign.”

Baughman emphasized that despite the difficulties Harris faced, including limited time and resources, her campaign performed better than expected. Her approval ratings improved over the course of the election — a rare outcome for a losing candidate.

Pérez-Armendáriz on Reclaiming How We Communicate

Words of Fear and Anger Are Filtering into the Culture

“Listen to children right now on the playground — it’s filtering down, right? This is getting into the culture of how people talk to each other. We have social media transmitting ways of talking about the opposition, how you talk about enemies and so forth. Little whispers in our ears.”

Be aware how the barrage of negative political rhetoric, fueled by bad actors wielding social media in powerful ways, is filtering down to everyday conversations, said Pérez-Armendariz.

How America voted in maps and charts

Donald Trump has won the race for the presidency of the United States, gaining a historic second term. He passed the critical threshold of 270 electoral college votes with a win in the state of Wisconsin and has continued to pick up key battleground states. Meanwhile, the Republicans are also set to take control of the Senate and are ahead in the latest tally of seats in the House of Representatives. For the data in the map, click here

Which states determined the presidency

To win the White House, a candidate needs 270 out of 538 electoral college votes. Each state is worth a differing number of votes depending on the size of the population. In most cases if a candidate gets the most votes in a state, they win all the electoral college votes for that state. A few of the most hotly contested battleground states voted for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020, but this year were won by Trump.

With a projected win in Wisconsin, Trump’s victory was secured. He also won the swing states of Nevada, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia. Pennsylvania was considered the biggest state to watch out for, with its 19 electoral votes. The state has been projected for Trump.

For the data in the map, click here The map above shows the voting in each county of Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris held sway in the state’s major cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Scranton, but Trump dominated elsewhere. Crucially, he overturned a 2020 Democratic victory in the north west county of Erie, which has voted for the winning presidential party in every election since 2008. Meanwhile, Arizona is the last of the seven pre-election battlegrounds and the only state yet to declare a result.

Biden won the state by just 10,000 votes in 2020 but Trump is currently leading Harris with around three-quarters of the vote counted.

Republicans projected to control Senate

There are also elections in both Houses of Congress. With a majority in both chambers, a president’s agenda is typically much easier to push through.

Republicans have already gained control of the Senate, picking up three seats from the Democrats in West Virginia, Montana, and Ohio. And with the presidency also secured, Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance will sit as president of the upper chamber.

Not all seats have yet been declared in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. All 435 seats were up for a vote and several have changed hands. A party needs 218 seats to control the House, and prior to election day Republicans held it. The final tallies will determine whether they retain that lead.

What exit polls tell us about how people voted

Early results suggest no single group or region drove the win for Donald Trump - instead small gains in many places added up to victory. The US exit polls help build a picture of how different groups of people have voted across the nation. Exit poll data is updated throughout the night. The latest numbers suggest that women broke for Harris but perhaps not by the margins her campaign had hoped, at 53% compared with 45% for Trump.

"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,Race is a key factor in the 2024 presidential election - Brookings Institution,"“I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump made this statement at the National Association of Black Journalists. Statements like this one, and others, have made race and racism dominant themes over the last several election cycles, and 2024 has continued that trend, with some important nuances associated with the Democratic presidential nomination of Vice President Harris. At a webinar taking place on Friday, October 11, 2024 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT, we draw attention to why comments like this matter, how they may influence voters, and the broader socio-historical implications for politics in America.

Race is traditionally a factor in presidential elections in the United States. Trump knows this and uses race as a means of dividing the country. Accordingly, he injected race into the campaign almost immediately following Harris’ emergence as the Democratic nominee, calling into question her racial identity. Trump said, “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black.” He added that “she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went, she became a Black person.” While Trump stated that he does not care how Harris racially identifies, he knows that many Americans do. One strategy in casting doubt about Vice President Harris’ Blackness is aiming to chip away at the Democratic voting bloc of Black voters, whether this be by voting for him or not voting at all.

For most Black Americans, this race-baiting will not work. However, there may be some who view Harris having a Jamaican father and Indian mother as being different from native-born Blacks. Research suggests that Blackness in America has always been diverse and fluid. Harris attending a historically Black college and university (HBCU) and being a member of the first collegiate Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., are key cultural attachments that others use as evidence of her Blackness. Nonetheless, there has been a substantial increase in people identifying as multiracial in the U.S. However, the one-drop rule is still alive and well. People with African ancestry are historically perceived as Black and often identify as such.

Yet, in addition to the focus on Harris’ racial identity, there has been public attention on the demonization of immigrants. While these racial tropes and attacks are also not new to politics, Trump’s rhetoric on this issue has been particularly disparaging. An analysis of Trump’s tweets about immigration during the 2016 election showed that his messages were overwhelmingly negative and focused on connecting immigrants with crime and other social ills.

However, it is important to note that scapegoating immigrants during challenging economic periods is often a staple of public attitudes linked to race and politics. With voters identifying economic concerns, including the rising cost of living as their dominant concern in poll after poll this election season, the Republican Party has continued the trend of blaming immigrants for challenges facing the country, including access to jobs, low wages, and affordable housing. With many Americans unable to afford housing in their community and struggling to afford basic living expenses, attacks on immigrants have unfortunately had some traction with certain blocs of voters. Accordingly, it is worth noting that research overwhelmingly shows that immigration actually enhances economic growth.

Given the prevalence of misinformation in American political discourse, it is not surprising that the spread of false and misleading information regarding immigrants is one of the factors that has moved the immigration policy debate in 2024. Recent survey research has found that a robust 80% of Americans have heard false statements, specifically from candidates and elected officials, that immigrants are “causing an increase in violent crime in the U.S.,” with 74% being exposed to misinformation that “immigrants are taking jobs and causing an increase in unemployment for people born in the U.S.” Consistent with academic literature finding that the anti-immigrant climate negatively impacts the health of immigrants, over a third of immigrants in this survey say the way former President Trump has talked about immigrants in his campaign has had a negative effect on how they are treated—45% among Asian American immigrants in the sample. As the anti-immigrant campaign messaging ramps up, it is important to recognize the impact on the mental health and perceived belonging those advertisements have on the immigrant community.

Across both the 2020 and 2022 elections, fighting racism has been a salient theme to voters. In fact, 10% of voters in the 2022 election reported that addressing racism and discrimination was one of the most important issues they wanted Congress and the president to address, including 22% of African American voters. Racism remains a high priority for registered voters, and this is particularly true for Harris supporters—56% of whom note that racial and ethnic inequality is “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election. This survey also found that Harris has a clear advantage compared to Trump to “effectively address issues around race” (+ nine percentage points).

From racial identity to immigration, it is clear that race and racism continue to be bedrocks on political campaigns. The unfortunate reality is that this focus distracts from voters objectively understanding key issues about work, immigration, and safety. In response to Trump’s attacks on Harris’ racial identity, she responded, “Honestly, I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president, who has consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people… I think the American people want better than that.” Maybe so, maybe not. What is clear is that race continues to be a factor in political campaigns, and its effects on political attitudes are potent.",Race is a key factor in the 2024 presidential election  Brookings Institution,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/race-is-a-key-factor-in-the-2024-presidential-election/

Harris campaign rallies key swing states, confident of momentum as polls show gains in battlegrounds

Millions of Americans will head to polling booths on Tuesday to cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election, in which Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are locked in a tight race.

There are 230 million eligible voters, but only about 160 million of them are registered. Nearly half of the 50 states in the United States, however, allow on-the-day registration while citizens can vote without registering in North Dakota.

More than 70 million people have already voted through postal ballots or at early in-person polling stations.

Voters will also elect 34 US senators (out of 100) and all 435 members for the US House of Representatives. Additionally, gubernatorial races will take place in 11 states and two territories (Puerto Rico and American Samoa).

The US stretches across six time zones. Using US East Coast time (ET), voting will start as early as 5am (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday and go as late as 1am (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday.

We break down when polls open and close across the states:

5am ET (10:00 GMT)

Polls open at different times from state to state. The earliest voting will start well before dawn in some municipalities in Vermont.

6am ET (11:00 GMT)

Polls open in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. Some polls in Indiana and Kentucky also open.

In Maine, polls open from 6am ET to 10am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality guidelines. In New Hampshire, polls open from 6am ET to 11am ET (16:00 GMT).

6:30am ET (11:30 GMT)

Polls open in the battleground state of North Carolina as well as the red states of Ohio and West Virginia. States that traditionally back Republicans are called red states.

7am ET (12:00 GMT)

Polls open in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina.

Some polls in Indiana, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan also open at this time. In Tennessee, voting starts from 7am ET to 10am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality.

Georgia is a critical swing state. In the 2020 election, Democrat Joe Biden won by 0.2 percentage points over Trump, making it the narrowest margin of victory that year.

From 1972 to 2016, Republican candidates would usually sweep Georgia. However, races have become tighter in the state recently due to demographic changes.

8am ET (13:00 GMT)

Polls open in Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. Some polls in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, South Dakota and Texas also open at this time.

In North Dakota, voting starts from 8am ET to 11am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality.

Arizona recently became a swing state when Biden defeated Trump by 0.3 percentage points four years ago. From 1952 to 2016, the Republican presidential candidate won in Arizona with one exception – Democrat Bill Clinton when he ran against Republican Robert Dole in 1996.

8am ET (13:30 GMT)

Arkansas starts voting.

9am ET (14:00 GMT)

People start casting ballots in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Polls also open at this time in some parts of South Dakota, Oregon and Texas and for the New Shoreham municipality in Rhode Island.

In Idaho, polls open from 9am ET to 11am ET (16:00 GMT) depending on the municipality.

10am ET (15:00 GMT)

Voting starts in California and Nevada as well as some parts of Oregon. In Washington, polls open from 10am ET to noon ET (17:00 GMT) depending on the municipality.

11am ET (16:00 GMT)

Some polls open in Alaska, a state with two time zones. The state’s other polls open at noon ET (17:00 GMT)

12pm ET (17:00 GMT)

Polls open in Hawaii.

Polls start to close at 6pm ET (23:00 GMT)

Some polls in Indiana and Kentucky close.

7pm ET (00:00 GMT)

Polls close in six states: Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and the remainder of Indiana and Kentucky.

Trump disputed the 2020 Georgia election result. He was later indicted on charges of election interference there. False claims about election fraud in the swing state in this election are already circulating.

Indiana, Kentucky and South Carolina are leaning towards Trump while Virginia and Vermont are expected to go to Harris.

7:30pm ET (00:30 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia.

In 2020 in North Carolina, Trump won the battleground state by 1.3 percentage points over Biden, and in 2016, Trump won the state by 3.6 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

From 1980 to 2020, Republicans have won in North Carolina in every election except 2008 when Democrat Barack Obama won against John McCain by 0.3 percentage points.

Ohio and West Virginia have historically voted Republican, and a Trump win is expected in the two states.

8pm ET (01:00 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington and the District of Columbia.

Most polls in Michigan and Texas also close at this time.

Pennsylvania is a swing state that Biden won by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. In 2016, Trump won against Clinton by 0.7 percentage points.

After a Democratic win in 1976, Republicans swept the state from 1980 to 1988. From 1992 to 2012, Democrats won Pennsylvania.

8:30pm ET (01:30 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in Arkansas, marking a conclusion of voting in half of the US states.

Arkansas is expected to go to Trump because Republicans have won comfortably in the state from 2000 to 2020.

9pm ET (02:00 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in 15 states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

These include three swing states: Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.

From 1976 to 2020, Republicans have won in Arizona every election except 1996 and 2020. In 2020, Biden beat Trump by 0.3 percentage points. In 2016, Trump beat Clinton by 3.6 percentage points.

From 1992 to 2020, Michigan has swung blue for Democrats every election except 2016 when Trump beat Clinton by 0.2 percentage points. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in the state by 2.8 percentage points. But US support for Israel’s war on Gaza could turn the sizeable number of Arab American voters in the state towards Trump or the Green Party’s Jill Stein.

Wisconsin has also historically turned blue, doing so in every election from 1988 to 2020 except in 2016 when Trump defeated Clinton by 0.7 percentage points. In 2020, Biden won the state by 0.7 percentage points.

10pm ET (03:00 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in Montana, Nevada and Utah.

Montana and Utah are expected to go to Trump. Nevada, however, is a swing state.

While Republicans won the state from 1976 to 1988, Democrats have won there since 2008. In 2020, Biden won by 2.4 percentage points. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump by 2.4 percentage points.

11pm ET (04:00 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

California is the most populous US state, and it is expected to go to Harris, who is from California and has represented the state in the US Senate and served as its attorney general.

From 1992 to 2020, Democrats have won comfortably in California.

Oregon and Washington are also likely to see a Harris victory while Idaho is expected to go to Trump.

Midnight ET (05:00 GMT on Wednesday)

Polls close in Hawaii and parts of Alaska.

Trump is expected to win in Alaska while Harris is expected to win in Hawaii.

"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,US Election Poses Risks But Energy Policy Will Muddle Through - BloombergNEF,"By Derrick Flakoll, North America Policy Associate, BloombergNEF

The upcoming US elections could reshape global climate progress. Former president Donald Trump and his Republican Party have vowed to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, a keystone climate law that Vice President Kamala Harris and her incumbent Democratic Party hope to build on.

The economic benefit of the US’s clean energy boom, and a closely divided Congress, will likely shield the IRA from major legislative changes regardless of who wins. But regulations – and looming tax bills – could still have a big impact.

Despite the parties’ seemingly opposing positions, Democrats and Republicans appear to be converging on different flavors of an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy. Republicans are often skeptical of climate spending and favor expanding fossil-fuel production and exports – but post-IRA investments in factories and clean energy have overwhelmingly gone to Republican districts.

Democrats want to double down on the energy transition and encourage a green industrial revolution on US soil, but Harris has also lately praised the US’s record oil and gas production as she worries about the political impacts of higher gasoline (petrol) prices and alienating oil and gas workers in Pennsylvania, a keystone state for her election.

Regardless of the president, a narrowly divided legislature will limit what can – or can’t – get done on the energy front. Either Harris or Trump will need both houses of Congress to pass most proposals they’re campaigning on.

Democrats are almost certain to lose the Senate; Republicans may lose the House of Representatives even if Trump wins. Either result would limit the president’s ability to end or expand US climate laws like the IRA without a rare bipartisan deal. Only a ‘trifecta’ – in which one party simultaneously controls the presidency and both houses of Congress – would allow more ambitious partisan reforms.

Still, presidents can act alone in several key areas. They can rewrite rules and priorities for federal agencies and programs like the IRA’s tax credits, grants and loans, which could dramatically change the impact on both emissions and firms. They can set tariffs that can scramble supply chains or protect infant industries. And they can veto Congress’s proposed laws. Trump could use this power to roll back President Joe Biden’s most ambitious green policies or reorient them from a focus on emissions to economic growth alone, while Harris would likely consolidate and build on Biden’s nascent initiatives.

Meanwhile, Congress’s post-election agenda will be driven by fights over the IRA and tax policy. Key tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term expire at the end of 2025. While Republicans will be tempted to end IRA programs to ‘pay for’ these tax cuts, they likely lack the votes to repeal IRA tax credits, as such a repeal would undermine popular clean energy projects in Republican territory.

A group of 18 Republican Representatives – more than the party’s current majority in the House – have signed an open letter warning against a too-hasty repeal of IRA tax credits. Still, more polarizing credits like those tied to electric vehicles (EVs) are at higher risk, as are unspent grant and loan programs.

Whoever wins, US energy policy, and US cleantech sectors, will do what they always do: muddle through. Trump could deal the energy transition a blow, but he can’t stop or reverse it any more than he could during his first term. Harris, meanwhile, will need to make political compromises that will likely keep US climate and energy policy far behind what it needs to meet the country’s net-zero goals.

BloombergNEF estimates that annual US investment in the energy transition must triple from now through 2030 – and then rise even further after that – to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. No matter the outcome of this election, there’s a lot more work to do before the US gets there.",US Election Poses Risks But Energy Policy Will Muddle Through  BloombergNEF,BloombergNEF,https://about.bnef.com/blog/us-election-poses-risks-but-energy-policy-will-muddle-through/

Already twice this century, networks have made calls that led to a contested election result, experts noted. Several factors this year make calling election results dicey for news networks, according to Northeastern University experts. AP Photo/Jae C. Hong

With Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck and neck in the polls, Northeastern University political experts say the 2024 presidential election could come down to a handful of ballots in one state, and recounts and lengthy court challenges.

Or, experts say, it may be a clear victory for one candidate or the other by 10 p.m. on election night.

“There’s a huge range of possibilities,” says Northeastern University polling expert David Lazer.

“It’s really a coin flip at this point,” adds John Wihbey, associate professor of media innovation and technology at Northeastern.

So how will we know who wins? The news media.

But Northeastern University experts say that litigation (both existing and anticipated), political polarization among the electorate, the culture of “scoops,” and the memories of the 2000 and 2020 presidential elections, and claims of political fraud put tremendous pressure on the newsrooms to make a call this year.

And that may mean a little bit of a wait on the evening of Nov. 5.

“I think there should be a note of caution, particularly in this election, and not be premature,” Wihbey says. “There is a really fine balance between making a rigorous, evidence-based call and yet not being premature.”



Meg Heckman, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern and a journalist with experience making newsroom election calls, concurs.

“Speed matters, but accuracy and honesty matter more,” Heckman says.

Elections are administered by the states, so there is no single U.S government agency or federal commission that tallies results and declares winners. Thus that role falls to the news media, with the Associated Press playing the role of the “definitive source.”

But that doesn’t mean that other networks will defer to the AP if they feel they can confidently make a call.",When and how is the call made to declare a winner on election night?

"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,Fact check: Was Elon Musk’s Starlink used to rig the US election? - Al Jazeera English,"Did the tech billionaire really use satellite-based technology to ‘steal’ the election for Donald Trump? No – voting equipment is not typically connected to the internet.

Some social media users claim to have found an explanation for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 election loss. They say billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes to benefit President-elect Donald Trump.

Starlink is an internet provider that uses satellites to provide connectivity; it’s a subsidiary of Musk’s commercial spaceflight company SpaceX.

“Musk’s Starlink uploaded votes in swing states,” one November 10 Threads post said. “Swing state voters went Dem downballot but Trump at the top? Unlikely. Starlink satellites exploding, destroying evidence.”

Starlink made headlines in recent weeks when the company distributed equipment to help people regain internet access in hurricane-hit areas. To some people, that move was furt​​her proof of the conspiracy.

“The Russians have access to Starlink terminals and therefore the satellites. The Russians are known hackers,” said another November 10 Threads post. “Elon Musk and the US gov. sent Starlink terminals to Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia due to the hurricanes.”

Other Threads users summarised the unsubstantiated claims: “People are saying Elon Musk used Starlink to steal the US Election for Donald Trump.”

These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

Election security experts and state and local election officials rebutted the claims, saying the 2024 presidential election was secure and there’s no evidence of Starlink-related fraud.

“Starlink is suspected by conspiracy theorists not because of what it does, but because Elon Musk owns it,” Mike Rothschild, a journalist, author and conspiracy theory expert, said.

This conspiracy theory circulated on Threads amid a larger wave of election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans’ false claims about 2020 election fraud.

“Conspiracy theories about lost elections being stolen are a natural way to cope with an unexpected outcome,” Rothschild said, adding that it’s important to “leave conspiracism behind and embrace reality”.

Election infrastructure is secure

Jen Easterly, director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, reported on November 6 that the agency had “no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure”.

Officials from swing states that received Starlink technology after the September and October hurricanes also said Starlink technology could not have been used to benefit Trump.

North Carolina’s tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet, Patrick Gannon, the North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson, said. State law prohibits connecting such equipment to the internet, he added.

“Satellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,” Gannon said. “In addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. We have no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone.”

The other six swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – have similar election security protocols to ensure voting equipment is never connected to the internet during ballot tabulation.

Even if Starlink had somehow been used to modify the vote count, there are systems designed to catch tabulation discrepancies, including risk-limiting audits, canvassing and certification of the election results, said Michael Specter, a Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor specialising in election security.

“None of these are foolproof, but each makes it significantly less likely that an attack would be successful,” Specter said.

Broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said. In some states, ballot tabulators are briefly connected to the internet to transmit results when polls close. And in many places, other election infrastructure, such as pollbooks with lists of digital voter registration records, has internet connectivity.

We found little evidence Starlink is widely used during elections. Even in Asheville, North Carolina’s Buncombe County, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, election officials told PolitiFact that Starlink was not used for any election functions.

Genya Coulter, senior election analyst for the OSET Institute, a nonprofit group focused on accurate, secure and transparent elections, said she knew Starlink technology had been used to support election infrastructure in one place: Tulare County, California. Trump won Tulare County with about 60 percent of the vote.

“Most of the rural part of the county has little to no access to broadband, and Starlink was used to have the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database,” Coulter said. Pollbooks are lists of digital voter registration records.

Vote tabulators weren’t connected to Starlink satellite internet, she said, adding that the county had about 28,000 in-person voters.

Regarding claims about Russian hackers swaying election outcomes, Coulter said she was “less worried about Russian hackers affecting vote totals and significantly more concerned” with the deluge of incorrect election information that Russian-linked groups distributed online before the election and the bomb threats targeting election infrastructure that officials said were “of Russian origin”.

What about reports of a Starlink satellite fireball?

On November 10, a Starlink satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere heading southeast from Washington to Texas and exploded.

Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and science data system group leader at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center, said there’s nothing noteworthy about that.

“This is not a case of suddenly deciding to retire this satellite within the past week,” McDowell said. “Such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years, they just are at random times and random places in the world so not often over the US at night where Americans can see it.”

According to US Space Force data, SpaceX removed this particular satellite from operation on August 2, at which point the satellite started lowering its orbit, McDowell said. SpaceX abandoned the satellite on October 13, McDowell added.

Stargazers in southwest United States reported seeing fireballs in the early morning hours of November 10. McDowell said that’s normal: During satellite reentry and breakup, observers can sometimes see fireballs moving slowly across the sky.

Why Democrats won Senate races while Trump won the presidency

Some of the posts that floated the Starlink conspiracy theory pointed to Democratic successes in some down-ballot races as evidence that something was off in the Trump-Harris results. Although there’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates from different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters do.

Ticket-splitting – when voters choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another – has become less common in recent election cycles as political polarisation has increased. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely.

Incumbency can help candidates win re-election. For instance, two swing states had Democratic incumbents keep their Senate seats: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity might have helped these candidates.

Controversy, or a lack thereof, can also affect candidates’ campaigns. In Arizona, for example, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the 2020 presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego, a retired US Marine and a Latino, in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate.

Specter, the professor, said split-ticket voting “does not provide sufficient evidence that any malfeasance has occurred”.

Our ruling

Threads posts said Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes in the 2024 election to benefit Trump.

Federal and state election officials rebutted claims of 2024 election fraud, including claims that Starlink manipulated the vote counts.

Voting machines aren’t typically connected to the internet and longstanding systems ensure votes are fairly and accurately tabulated.

We found only one instance – in California, not a swing state – of Starlink technology being used to support election infrastructure, such as having the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database.

We rate these claims Pants on Fire!

What's the focus for Harris and Trump in the last few days of the US campaign?

A week before election day, Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to “turn the page on fear and divisiveness” at a campaign rally in the battleground state of Michigan.

Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump, at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, hit out at his critics, including former First Lady Michelle Obama, whom he called “nasty.”

Incendiary devices were set off Monday at two ballot drop boxes – one in Portland and another in nearby Vancouver, Washington – destroying hundreds of ballots in what one official called a “direct attack on democracy”.

Harris and Trump remain neck and neck, with analysts predicting that the election will come down to razor-thin margins in a few key swing states.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s daily election poll tracker, Harris holds a narrow lead in the national polls, with a 1.4 percentage point advantage as of Tuesday. This marks a slight dip from the previous week when she was ahead by 1.7 percentage points.

Seven key swing states will likely decide the results of this election. Both campaigns have put their focus and efforts there.

Those seven states include Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s daily poll tracker, Harris retains a narrow lead in Michigan. Meanwhile, Trump holds a slight edge over Harris in Pennsylvania and Nevada and enjoys a more substantial lead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia.

And in Wisconsin, according to FiveThirtyEight, not even a tenth of a percentage point separates the two.

In all seven states, the candidates are within two points of each other, well within the polls’ margins of error, leaving each state a toss-up just days before the final vote.

What was Kamala Harris up to on Sunday?

Harris focused on Michigan, where her main event was an evening campaign rally and concert in Ann Arbor, alongside her running mate Tim Walz and the singer Maggie Rogers.

In 2022, Michigan saw the highest youth voter turnout in the country, with long lines at polling stations on college campuses, during the midterm election. This year, Democrats are trying to rekindle that energy by organising events like the rally held in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan.

However, about 30 pro-Palestinian protesters confronted Harris at the event. The nominee acknowledged the chants, telling the protesters, “Hey, guys, I hear you.” The group was chanting, “Israel bombs, Kamala pays, how many kids have you killed today?”

After acknowledging the group, Harris said, “On the subject of Gaza, we all want this war to end as soon as possible and to get the hostages out, and I will do everything in my power to make it so.”

Before that, she held afternoon campaign events in Saginaw and Macomb County. Harris pitched to working-class voters by emphasising the administration’s efforts to create more factory jobs in the state and her support for labour unions.

Before flying to Michigan, Harris also took a jab at Trump, referencing comments made at Trump’s New York rally the day before, where a comedian referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage.”

“[It] really highlighted the point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign,” which is that Trump is “fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country, and it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker”, Harris said.

“There’s a big difference between he and I,” she added.

According to Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, who was reporting from Washington, DC, Harris’s campaign is trying to capitalise on some of the racist language that came out of Trump’s rally.

“This is a way for the Harris campaign to try to persuade those yet-undecided Latino voters, particularly in the swing state of Pennsylvania, to vote for her,” Jordan said.

Pennsylvania is home to more than 450,000 Puerto Ricans, who make up 8 percent of the state’s population. Just 0.2 percentage points separate Trump and Harris there, and Pennsylvania offers 19 Electoral College votes – the most among the swing states.

What was Donald Trump up to on Monday?

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in Georgia. He delivered remarks at the inaugural National Faith Summit 2024 in Powder Springs in the afternoon before holding a rally in Atlanta in the evening.

During his events, Trump dismissed claims that he or his supporters were comparable to Nazis and fascists.

“I’m not a Nazi. I’m the opposite of a Nazi,” Trump told the crowd assembled at Georgia Tech. “Now, the way they talk is so disgusting and just horrible.”

“My father – I had a great father, tough guy. He used to always say, never use the word Nazi. Never use that word.”

He then criticised Harris for “using the f-word.” In response to comments from Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, who stated that the former president met the definition of a fascist, Harris expressed her agreement with that assessment. Trump said of Harris: “She’s a fascist, okay? She’s a fascist.”

During his event in Atlanta, he also called former First Lady Michelle Obama “nasty” after she condemned his rhetoric over the weekend.

Georgia is an important key swing state. Trump won it in the 2016 presidential race and lost it in 2020.

However, in his Georgia events, Trump was silent on the racist remarks about Puerto Rico at his New York rally.

“But that’s to be expected from the former president,” Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said, reporting from outside the ex-president’s rally in Atlanta.

“Donald Trump works on the principle that you never apologise and you never back down,” he added.

What’s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?

Harris will speak in Washington, DC

Harris is expected to address a crowd of 20,000 people in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night in what her campaign is billing as the former prosecutor’s “closing argument”.

Harris will speak at the Ellipse, just outside the White House.

That is the same spot where Trump addressed his supporters in his infamous “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6, 2021, right before a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol.

Meanwhile, Tim Walz – Harris’s running mate – will campaign on Tuesday in Georgia, a key swing state where Trump has been actively rallying his base.

Trump is rallying in Allentown, Pennsylvania

Trump will hold a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is a critical battleground state and both Trump and Harris have made several visits there in recent weeks.

Given the scale of the Puerto Rican vote in the state, and the racist comments at the Trump rally against the US territory, Trump’s campaign visits could become even more important to his bid to win the state, where he marginally leads at the moment, according to poll trackers.

While Puerto Ricans living on the island do not cast ballots in the presidential election, Americans of Puerto Rican origin or ancestry are a key demographic in some swing states.

“Puerto Rico is trash? We are Americans, Donald Trump,” TV host Sunny Hostin said on the popular show The View on Monday. “We vote.” Hostin’s family is from Puerto Rico.

.@Sunny Hostin: “This Puerto Rican has something to say about the island that I love, where my family is from. Puerto Rico is trash? We are Americans, Donald Trump.” “My fellow Puerto Ricans, trash collection day is November 5, 2024. Don’t forget it.” pic.twitter.com/fFC4aMeZUg — The View (@TheView) October 28, 2024

Whoever wins Pennysylvania might well win the White House, analysts believe.

“I’m really looking at Pennsylvania.” Thomas Gift, associate professor of political science in the UCL School of Public Policy, told Al Jazeera.

“Some recent forecasting showed that if Donald Trump can win in Pennsylvania, his odds for winning the White House go up to 96 percent; if Kamala Harris wins Pennsylvania, her odds of winning the White House go up to 91 percent,” Gift added.","US election: 7 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/29/us-election-7-days-left-what-polls-say-what-harris-and-trump-are-up

For much of the 2024 US presidential campaign, polls and pundits rated the race too close to call. Then Donald Trump delivered a commanding victory over Kamala Harris, winning at least five battleground states, and performing unexpectedly well in other places. He is now poised to become the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, and could enter office with a Republican-controlled House and Senate at his back. So were the polls wrong about it being a tight contest?

At the national level, they certainly appeared to underestimate Trump for the third election in a row. But in the battleground states such as Pennsylvania, where most of the polling was focused, Trump's margin of victory was typically within striking distance of his performance in the polls, even if the forecasts were slightly lower than the final outcome. The average polling error seen in these swing states was not actually that big. Still, in tight campaigns, small changes can make a big difference.

Ahead of the results, media outlets including the BBC warned that despite the close race in the polls, it could end up looking like a landslide for either candidate, given the margin of error. In some less closely-watched parts of the US, polls underestimated Trump's support more significantly - a sign of some blind spots, said Michael Bailey, a professor at Georgetown University and author of the book Polling at a Crossroads. ""At a glance, in the battleground states, polls ran a little hot for Harris but really not so bad, but when you dig deeper, it's all a little less impressive,"" he said. In Florida, for example, polls tracked by RealClearPolitics in the final weeks of the election put Trump ahead by about five points. He won by a greater margin of 13. In New Jersey, Harris was expected to win by nearly 20 percentage points, based on the two most recent polls tracked by the site. Her margin was more slender, closer to 10. ""Just imagine if we knew that or had a better sense of that a month ago. I don't know that it would change the election but it would certainly change our expectations,"" Prof Bailey said. He said pollsters this year may have leaned too heavily on bets that people would behave roughly as they did in 2020 - failing to anticipate the depth of the swing among Latino and young voters toward Trump. ""These models that assume so heavily that we're going to get a repeat... they're a disaster when there's a big change,"" he said.

But pollster Nate Silver, founder of the 538 polling analysis site, said there were signs of peril for those who were looking. Writing about the election results, he noted a poll from New York City last month, which indicated Trump making major inroads in the traditional Democratic stronghold. ""This is a problem the party should have been prepared for, because there was plenty of evidence for it in polls and election data,"" he wrote. Debate about the polls is sure to continue in the months ahead. That is particularly true in a year in which figures like Trump and billionaire supporter Elon Musk have promoted betting markets - many of which did forecast a decisive Trump victory - as a more accurate alternative. Experts said the polling profession does face challenges. Response rates to surveys have plunged, as it becomes easier for people to screen calls from unknown numbers. The fall has also coincided with rising distrust of media and institutions - a feature particularly pronounced among Trump supporters that some argue has led to their under-representation. Prof Bailey said the big miss in the much-discussed poll of Iowa by Ann Selzer - that was released days ahead of the election and indicated a three-point lead for Harris in the state - showed the risks of the traditional approach. To make up for such issues, many of the most high-profile polls now function more like models, with firms weighting responses from different groups and making other assumptions about factors such as turnout. Many pollsters have also shifted to using online surveys, but experts said those were known for being unreliable. This year, voters who were inclined to fill out online polls were more likely to be Democrats, James Johnson of London-based polling firm JL Partners told the Times of London newspaper. They were ""more likely to be young, they’re more likely to be highly-engaged, they’re more likely to be working from home,"" he said.

Prof Bailey said pollsters had to ""move on"" from random samples and get comfortable with modelling, while doing a better job testing and explaining their assumptions. But Prof Jon Krosnick of Stanford University said without truly random samples, surveys would remain vulnerable to error. Pollsters are ""trying hard but they keep trying to be too clever,"" he said. ""What we need to do is go back to basics and spend the time and money that it takes to do polls accurately.""",Did the US election polls fail?

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,US election results: How did opinion polls undercount Trump voters again? - Al Jazeera English,"It’s the third consecutive election in which opinion polls have underestimated Trump’s support.

Ahead of the United States presidential elections on Tuesday, public opinion polls had predicted a neck-and-neck race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Yet eventually, Trump cruised to a comfortable victory, defying most polls. He has already won five of the seven swing states – Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin – and appears poised to win the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada. Most of these wins are by margins larger than the polls had forecast.

And, while most pollsters had predicted a narrowing margin between Harris and Trump in the popular vote, almost all showed Harris ahead. In the end, Trump is on course to not just win the popular vote – but to do so by a margin of close to 5 million votes. That’s a win no Republican can boast of since George HW Bush in 1988.

Overall, Trump has already won 295 Electoral College votes, comfortably more than the 270 needed to win, while Harris won 226. If he wins Arizona and Nevada as is predicted, Trump will end up with 312 Electoral College votes.

So how did the opinion polls go wrong – so wrong?

What did the polls predict about swing states?

Most national polls, weeks into the vote, predicted the two candidates deadlocked, deeming the race too close to call.

A few days before the elections, some pollsters, such as poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight then shifted slightly and predicted that Harris was more likely to win, although by a small gap of less than 2 percent.

In the seven battleground states, Harris was predicted – based on an average of polls by aggregator FiveThirtyEight – to win a majority in the traditionally Democrat, or Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Trump was leading in the polls in North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, while there was almost nothing separating the two candidates in Nevada, according to the polls.

On election night, Trump won all three of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He is expected to win Arizona handsomely. And he is ahead in Nevada by three percentage points – well beyond what the polls had predicted.

What about other states Trump won?

In Iowa, the Midwestern state that has long been solidly Republican, Selzer and Co, a trusted polling company owned by analyst J Ann Selzer, surprisingly predicted Harris winning by three percentage points over Trump in the closing days of the campaign.

To be sure, it was an outlier poll: an Emerson College poll that came out at almost the same time showed Trump winning the state by nine percentage points.

But Selzer is widely respected in the polling industry and has repeatedly called Iowa correctly in presidential and Senate races over the decades.

She cited widespread anger among white women over the overturn of hard-won abortion rights by Trump-appointed Supreme Court Judges back in 2022, and said previously undecided women voters were breaking late for Harris, giving her the edge.

Trump, on his social media channel, Truth Social, condemned Selzer’s poll, calling her an “enemy” and saying that the poll was wrong “by a lot”.

Eventually, Trump won the state by 13 percentage points – more than what even many Republican-funded polls had predicted.

When polls get it so wrong, it “exacerbates a key challenge in this race: the perceived lack of legitimacy of polling”, Tina Fordham of risk advisory company Fordham Global Foresight told Al Jazeera.

What about states that Trump lost?

Pollsters got it wrong even in several states that Harris won – undercounting Trump’s support and thereby predicting a far great margin of victory for the vice president in solidly Blue states than what happened in the election:

New York: The polling average at the start of November 5 had Harris winning by 16 percentage points. She won by 11 points.

The polling average at the start of November 5 had Harris winning by 16 percentage points. She won by 11 points. New Jersey: Harris, per FiveThirtyEight, was forecast to win by 17 percentage points. She beat Trump – but only by 5 points.

Harris, per FiveThirtyEight, was forecast to win by 17 percentage points. She beat Trump – but only by 5 points. New Hampshire: The polls suggested Harris would win by 5 percentage points. She barely beat Trump by two percentage points.

Did pollsters warn of possible errors?

Yes, pollsters always point out that their surveys operate within margins of error in their calculations – about 4 percent in many cases. That means that their predictions could be off by 4 percent in either direction: if Harris is shown leading Trump 48 percent to 44 percent, for instance, they could actually end up equal, or Harris could end up with an 8 percent win eventually.

Nate Silver, who founded pollster FiveThirtyEight, and now anchors the newsletter, Silver Bulletin, wrote in The New York Times ahead of the vote that his “gut” went with Trump. Silver had earlier predicted a deadlock, but it was possible, he noted, that the polls were underestimating the numbers of Trump supporters because they could not reach them for surveys.

But in the final days before November 5, Silver was one of several pollsters who said their models had shifted slightly more towards Harris, giving her a 48 percent chance at victory over Trump’s 47 percent.

Have polls got it wrong before?

Yes. Polling in the US began from newspapers collecting local opinions in the 1880s. Predictions have often been right, historically.

But of late, they have often also been horribly wrong.

In 2016, opinion polls correctly predicted the popular vote for Hillary Clinton, but also had her winning, comfortably, in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, that Trump eventually won. Their forecast of Clinton winning the Electoral College was proved wrong.

Polls were off in 2020 again, when COVID-19 restrictions greatly limited surveys. Most polls correctly predicted that Joe Biden would win the Electoral College and national vote. But they significantly overestimated the support for Democrats by an “unusual magnitude”, according to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), while undercounting voters backing Trump. Researchers called it the least accurate polling in 40 years.

Then, in 2022, polls got it wrong the other way – for the midterm elections.

Some polls predicted that Republicans would sweep the House and Senate that year. In the end, the race was much closer, at least in the Senate, where neither party won a majority, but Democrats ended up gaining control 51- 49, with the support of independents who caucus with them. Republicans, as predicted, won the House 222 – 213.

Why do polls get it wrong?

It all comes down to who participates in their surveys, how representative they are of the electorate, and how truthfully they respond, say researchers. Without accurate data, polls mean nothing.

As Silver acknowledged in his New York Times column, one key challenge pollsters face is getting enough numbers of likely voters to respond to their surveys. Usually, opinions are collected over phone calls, but that has become more difficult because of caller ID applications that help people screen calls seen as spam.

Republicans, in particular, may be less likely than Democrats to speak to the media or respond to surveys, and have been underrepresented in previous polls, according to findings by AAPOR. It doesn’t help that Trump has also publicly attacked opinion polls as “fake”, likely further causing his supporters to drift from participating. Trump has often attacked the mainstream media, calling the press the “enemy of the state” in 2019.

By contrast, Democrats, especially college-educated people, are more likely to engage, and also likely to be overrepresented, analysts say.

Although pollsters are trying to close the participation gap by using emails and online surveys, some online surveys tend to attract only certain types of participants because they offer compensation, academic Jerome Viala-Guadefroy writes in the research publication The Conversation.

“(That compensation) leads to issues of accuracy and representation,” he wrote.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions appeared to make surveys more difficult. AAPOR found that states that had the highest polling errors corresponded with states that had higher cases of the virus.

Did online betting sites do better than pollsters?

American University professor and polls pundit Allan Lichtman who had rightly predicted the 2016 elections in favour of Trump, admitted that his predictions this time – he had forecast a Harris win – were wrong. In a post on X on Thursday, Lichtman said he wanted to “assess why the keys were wrong and what we can learn from this error”.

Meanwhile, online, a new crop of prediction betting companies, where people can put money on topics like crypto or election candidates, are gloating and lapping up praise for correctly predicting a more likely Trump win. Thousands who gambled on Trump are looking at potential payouts of about $450m collectively.

In the days just before the November 5 vote, the odds of Trump winning increased on at least five online betting websites, providing, some say, a much more realistic picture than the polls did.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,US election results: How did Donald Trump break the ‘blue wall’ – again? - Al Jazeera English,"Former President Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election has been helped in no small part by his winning of multiple so-called “blue wall” states that are traditional Democrat strongholds.

“It appears Trump has breached the blue wall, or at least enough of it, to win the presidency,” David Schultz, an author and political science professor at Minnesota’s Hamline University, told Al Jazeera.

As the Electoral College voting map gradually turned red after polls closed and votes were being counted, observers initially suspected the “red mirage” effect, which can be produced as more Republican voters (denoted by red) tend to go to the polls in person and more Democrats (denoted by blue) mail in their votes.

Once Trump crossed the line of 270 Electoral votes, however, Democratic hopes of catching up to his lead in the early counting stage were dashed.

What is the red mirage?

Historically, more mail-in ballots are sent by Democrats while more Republicans vote in person.

During the 2020 election, the electoral map looked similarly red in the early hours of counting, leading Trump to claim an early victory, before results in critical battleground states had been announced.

When results concluded after mail-in ballots were counted, Democrat Joe Biden emerged as a winner, after counting of postal votes showed he had won back Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, some of which are blue wall states and all of which had been won by the Republicans in the 2016 election.

Similar blue shifts after an initial red mirage were expected by some analysts this year. However, by 6am ET (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Associated Press (AP) had projected 277 Electoral College votes for Trump, seven more than the 270 required to secure a presidency.

Later on Wednesday, that number ballooned further, after Michigan, one of the so-called blue wall states, was also called for Trump.

What is a blue wall state?

A blue wall state is one the Democrats have reliably won through most of US modern history.

Precisely, these are states that voted for Democrats in every election between 1992 and 2012. They include California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware and Vermont as well as the District of Columbia.

In 2016, Trump breached the blue wall, flipping several of those states to red in the election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. These included Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – all three of which were again major battleground states during the latest election.

In 2020, President Joe Biden won back all three of these states, seemingly resurrecting the blue wall.

What happened in the three swing states behind the blue wall?

Away from the swing states, AP called reliable Harris wins in all the other blue wall states. However, AP called Trump wins in the three critical battleground states behind the blue wall – enough to cost Harris the presidency.

Here is how Trump fared in the three swing states considered to be behind the blue wall this year:

Pennsylvania: AP has called a Trump win in Pennsylvania, which has 19 Electoral votes, by two percentage points. Ninety-eight percent of the votes have been counted.

AP has called a Trump win in Pennsylvania, which has 19 Electoral votes, by two percentage points. Ninety-eight percent of the votes have been counted. Wisconsin: AP also called a Trump win in Wisconsin by 0.9 percentage points, with about 99 percent of the votes counted. Wisconsin has 10 Electoral votes.

AP also called a Trump win in Wisconsin by 0.9 percentage points, with about 99 percent of the votes counted. Wisconsin has 10 Electoral votes. Michigan: By Wednesday evening, AP also called Michigan for Trump. He is leading the state by 1.4 percentage points, with nearly 99 percent of the votes counted. Michigan carries 15 Electoral College votes.

How did Trump breach the blue wall?

People are over the pandemic

Schultz said he believed Biden was able to reclaim blue wall swing states from Trump in 2020 in part because of the way Trump handled the COVID-19 pandemic during his presidency.

More than 1.1 million people died during the pandemic in the US – from the time of the emergency declaration in January 2020 until when it was lifted in May 2023.

During the early months of the outbreak, Trump undermined scientists and spread false claims about the coronavirus on his social media platforms, such as the idea that children are “almost immune” to it.

Anti-vaccine misinformation spread and people in many Republican-led states started rallying for relaxed quarantine restrictions and questioned mandatory vaccine requirements.

In February 2021, a Lancet commission tasked with assessing Trump’s health policy found that 40 percent of deaths from the virus in the US could have been averted if the US death toll corresponded with that in other high-income Group of Seven (G7) countries.

Cost of living and the economy

Now, however, “economic issues along with feelings of being ignored drove the Trump victory”, Schultz said. Democrats “failed to execute well in the three blue wall states”, focusing too much on abortion over other issues such as economic policies that would appeal to working-class voters, he said.

A preliminary national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research showed that 51 percent of voters trusted Trump with handling the economy compared with the 47 percent who trusted Harris.

According to the exit poll, 31 percent of voters said the economy mattered most in shaping their decision to vote, whereas only 14 percent cited abortion.

“The Harris campaign did not necessarily do a good job of explaining how her policies would help the middle class, or at least that message wasn’t really resonating with a lot of voters,” Melissa Deckman, a political scientist and the CEO of Public Religion Research Institute, told Reuters news agency.

Choice of running mate

Deckman added that Harris’s VP choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was one of “several mistakes” made by the Democrats in the run-up to this election. This is because Walz did not help Harris win any swing states. Minnesota has voted blue in every single election since 1976.

In 2016, third-party candidate Jill Stein won 132,000 votes across Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, inroads that are believed to have contributed to Democrat Hillary Clinton losing the race.

So, what cost the Democrats vital blue wall states in this election?

Pennsylvania: Failing to ‘speak’ to working-class voters

“Harris lost Pennsylvania because she failed to speak to working-class voters and thought abortion would drive enough women to the polls to help her win,” Schultz said.

The Democrats campaigned more heavily on women’s rights issues than the Republicans in this, the first election since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade court ruling and ended a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy all over the US. Laws regarding abortion were effectively returned to individual states to decide.

However, early exit polls released while polling was still continuing showed that Harris had won the support of 54 percent of women in the state – less than Biden did in 2020, when he gained the support of 57 percent of women.

Wisconsin: Worries about healthcare

Wisconsin was reliably blue for decades, but Trump defeated Clinton there in 2016 by appealing to largely white, working-class voters who were concerned about rising healthcare costs as well as wages and poverty.

This time, “Harris lost Wisconsin because she lost the working class and did not win women, suburbs and young voters,” Schultz said.

In particular, the opioid crisis in the US – rampant addiction and overuse of prescription opioids and illegal opioids such as heroin – has badly rattled Wisconsin, where multiple polls this year suggested that healthcare had become a key issue for voters in the state.

According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin started more than two decades ago because there was overprescription of medical opioids and because heroin, an illegal opioid, had become cheaper and more widely available. In 2022, 1,828 people in Wisconsin died of a drug overdose, more than double the number from 2015. The synthetic opioid fentanyl was found in 73 percent of all overdose deaths in Wisconsin, according to a state attorney’s office report in August 2024.

Harris ran on the promise that she would lower the cost of pharmaceutical drugs and cancel medical debt as well as bolster the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which provides health insurance to middle and low-income Americans. Trump, on the other hand, said he would find an alternative to the ACA.

Michigan: Democrats’ support for Israel in war on Gaza

Michigan was not considered a swing state before 2016 because it did not flip-flop between the two parties – from 1976 to 1988, Republicans always won in Michigan. However, the presidential contest in Michigan has always been competitive.

In the second edition of his 2019 book, Presidential Swing States, analyst Rafael Jacob also wrote that since 1980, the winner in Michigan has always been the overall election winner, with just two exceptions – George W Bush in 2000 and 2004.

Jacob added that even when voters in Michigan chose Democratic presidents, they voted for Republican governors in state-level elections, concluding that Michigan voters are not very partisan.

During this election, Israel’s war on Gaza has emerged as a key issue in Michigan. According to the World Population Review, Michigan is the US state with the highest number of Arab Americans – 211,225 – as of this year, and there are an estimated 2.1 million Arab Americans in total in the US.

These voters expressed discontent with Trump and Harris since both candidates have expressed unequivocal support for Israel in its war on Gaza, which began on October 7, 2023 after a Hamas-led assault on villages and army outposts in southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,139 people and the capture of 251. Since the war began, at least 43,391 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardments and ground assaults in Gaza, while many thousands more are lost and presumed dead under the rubble.

Many Arab Americans instead said they would vote for Jill Stein, this year’s presidential nominee for the Green Party, who campaigned on the promise of pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and holding Israel accountable to international law.

The Democrats, as well as European Green Party members, warned that Stein would dent the Democrat vote, enabling Trump to win swing states and hence, the presidency.

Between October 30 and October 31, she was polling at 1.7 percent in Michigan, 1 percent in Wisconsin and 0.8 percent in Pennsylvania, according to Brazil-based analytics and data intelligence website AtlasIntel.

In Michigan, she won 0.8 percent of the vote, as well as 0.5 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and 0.4 percent in Wisconsin.

In Michigan, Stein and other third-party candidates combined won 2 percent of the popular vote, or 109,777 votes, based on the count so far.

Elites vs. working class: Why some Democrats think they lost to Trump

The pre-election predictions were clear: The contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris would be decided by the tiniest of margins.

But the final result of the US presidential election has seemingly defied those forecasts, with former President Donald Trump winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College comfortably.

So how badly has Harris done, and where did her campaign go wrong — so wrong that Trump could end up with the largest popular vote margin of victory for any Republican candidate in 36 years?

What was the outcome of the US election?

Trump has already won 295 Electoral College votes while Harris stands at 226. The majority mark is 270.

Although ballots for voting precincts in many swing states have not been called, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Philadelphia, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, Trump has already been declared winner in five of them, because the lead he enjoys there exceeds the votes still to be counted.

Nevada and Arizona are the only two states that have not yet been called, but pollsters now predict Trump should win both — which would put Trump’s final Electoral College count at 312 votes.

Trump has also already won nearly 73 million votes, compared to 68 million votes for Harris.

Prior to this election, George W Bush was the last Republican to win the popular vote 20 years ago. Bush won 62,040,610 votes and 286 electoral votes in comparison to Democratic nominee John Kerry, who secured 59,028,444 votes and 251 electoral votes.

The last time a Republican won the popular vote by a larger margin than the one Trump currently enjoys was Bush’s father, George HW Bush, in 1988.

Harris appears poised to lose all seven swing states. And the margin of her victory in decidedly “blue” or Democrat-leaning states has also shrunk. In the 2020 US election, Biden was up 16 points against Trump in New Jersey, for instance, whereas Harris won the state by only 5 points this time — that’s almost within the margin of error for many pollsters.

She has also underperformed in neighbouring New York state, another deep blue stronghold. With 97 percent of votes counted, Harris has won by 11 percentage points. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in New York by 23 percentage points.

So how did Harris’s campaign collapse?

A late start?

More than two years ago, in 2022, a New York Times poll found that only 26 percent of Democrats wanted their president, Joe Biden, to represent the party again in the 2024 race. In other words, three out of four Democrats were calling for a new leader.

Yet, following the party’s success in the midterm elections that year, the Democrats decided to back Biden as their candidate for 2024.

It was only after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024 that Biden pulled out of the race the following month. Harris had only four months to prepare and run her campaign. Despite some calls for a primary process to elect the party’s new face, most heavyweight Democratic Party figures — including former President Barack Obama and wife Michelle — quickly endorsed Harris.

She was eventually nominated without a primary. That meant that Harris was never tested this year in a contest against other presidential aspirants from her own party — which had a fait accompli thrust upon it.

Mixed messaging: Different from Biden — or not?

Harris had to pick up the campaign baton in July from a deeply unpopular president, whose ratings had been hovering in the low 40s. After the Trump-Biden debate that pushed the Democratic Party to change its nominee, Trump led Biden 49 percent to 43 percent in approval ratings, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.

The vice president tried to distinguish her campaign from Biden’s, promising that she was “turning the page” and that “we are not going back”. However, when pushed in interviews or on TV shows about Bidenomics — Biden’s economic policies — in particular, she struggled to differentiate herself from the president.

When asked whether there is anything she would have done differently than Biden over the past four years in an interview on The View in October, Harris responded, “There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of — and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.”

This, at a time when approval of the economy is at a low, and inflation is yet to come down to pre-COVID-19 levels.

“There is not a thing that comes to mind” became a phrase that the Trump campaign would use in advertisements to portray Harris as an extension of Biden’s legacy, with accompanying taglines like “prices still rising”, and “illegal crossings surge”.

But Harris also lost voters among some key constituencies that had long backed the Democratic Party, even compared to Biden. And Trump’s ability to shave away voters from Harris while bringing them over to his Make America Great Again (MAGA) coalition, proved to be a winning strategy.

Lost voters: Arab and Muslim Americans

Harris lost ground with Arab American and Muslim voters because of the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel’s brutal war on Gaza and Lebanon. This culminated in the emergence of the Abandon Harris campaign that was endorsed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim advocacy group in the US, by the time of the election, Stein led with 42 percent of the Muslim vote in the US with Harris at 41 percent and Trump at 10 percent.

On Election Day, this trend would bear fruit for Trump. Dearborn, Michigan, which has one of the highest concentrations of Arab-Americans in the US, voted 47 percent for Trump, 28 percent for Harris, and 22 percent for Jill Stein, according to numbers reported by the city clerk for that district.

Black voters shifting away

Black voters have been the single most dedicated voting bloc for the Democratic Party since the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932.

Expectations for Black support were high for Harris, being the first mixed-race candidate of African and Indian American heritage in the election. She was also in the running to become the second African American to make it to the White House.

But she faced headwinds.

A Gallup poll last year showed that the proportion of Black adults in the US who consider themselves Democrats had decreased from 77 percent in 2020 to 66 percent.

In the current election, Black voters supported Trump at levels not seen since George W Bush’s election in 2000.

According to exit polls from the Associated Press, Trump won 20 percent of the Black vote this time. He won 13 percent of the community’s vote in 2020 and 8 percent in 2016.

In Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state in the 2024 election, Harris lost 3 percentage points in Black support compared to 2020, with 89 percent versus Biden’s 92 percent. Trump would gain 3 points, from 7 percent in 2020 to 10 percent this time.

In Wisconsin, the numbers were even more stark. Harris’s support among Black voters fell by 15 percentage points — 77 percent versus 92 percent for Biden. Trump’s voter share soared from 8 percent in 2020 to 21 percent in 2024.

“Frustrations are being made clear in this rising percentage of Black voters [who are] taking a different look at the Republican Party in general, and are exploring some curiosities with Trump, despite his racial baggage,” said Adolphus Belk, a political science professor at Winthrop University in South Carolina, referring to a string of comments and actions by Trump that have bee criticised as racist over the years.

What happened to the Latino vote?

Harris also lost support among Latino voters. Exit polls revealed a substantial 14 percentage-point increase in Trump’s support among this demographic compared to the previous presidential election in 2020.

The economy was the number one concern among Latino voters. Juxtapose these concerns with many seeing the economy lagging under Biden-Harris, and the vice president was always facing an uphill battle.

Latino voters, especially those in older age groups, were predominantly concerned with rising inflation rates, escalating healthcare expenses, and the increasing cost of housing, which took precedence over broader issues, according to a recent AP survey.

Meanwhile, the Democratic campaign emphasised themes such as democratic values, reproductive rights, and immigration policy.

What about women voters?

Women voters, a key part of the Harris campaign coalition, were anticipated to show heavy support for Harris at the polls on Election Day. A targeted advertising campaign urged conservative women to cast their ballots for Harris. Moreover, polls indicated that Harris maintained a substantial 20-point advantage over Trump on the issue of abortion rights.

Trump has consistently taken credit for the Supreme Court’s June 2022 verdict overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 judgment that made abortion a national right. Three conservative appointments to the court by Trump had enabled the 2022 decision.

However, early national exit polls revealed that Harris secured the support of 54 percent of women voters, falling short of Biden’s performance in 2020 when he garnered 57 percent of the female vote.

But surveys before the election, and exit polls after the voting, both showed that women in the US rated inflation and other concerns about the economy as the most important issue before them — much more than abortion rights.

Harris lost the blue wall

The traditionally Democratic “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin unexpectedly shifted to Republican control in the 2024 US presidential election, paving the way for Donald Trump’s triumph over Vice President Kamala Harris.

This mirrored Trump’s 2016 campaign strategy, when he penetrated the blue wall, rather than the 2020 election in which Joe Biden successfully recaptured these crucial swing states for the Democratic Party.

In Michigan, Trump eked out a win with a razor-thin margin of 1.4 percentage points. Pennsylvania proved slightly more decisive, with Trump winning by three percentage points. Wisconsin delivered the closest contest, where Trump won by just over one percentage point.

These aren’t the only swing states Trump won. Trump appears poised to win all swing states, totalling 93 electoral votes.

Pennsylvania: 19 electoral votes

North Carolina: 16 electoral votes

Georgia: 16 electoral votes

Michigan: 15 electoral votes

Arizona: 11 electoral votes

Wisconsin: 10 electoral votes

Nevada: 6 electoral votes

The blue wall’s collapse made a pathway to victory impossible for Harris. With that, the game was over.",US election result: Where did Harris and her campaign go wrong?

"Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,"US election: 6 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to - Al Jazeera English","With just six days remaining before the election, both candidates are rallying support in key swing states.

With just one week remaining until the US election, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to supporters from the Ellipse in Washington, DC – the location where her opponent and former President Donald Trump addressed supporters before the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Meanwhile, Trump was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, just two days after a comedian made racist remarks about Puerto Rico from the podium during his rally in New York, triggering a firestorm of criticism.

With six days remaining until the November 5 vote, both candidates, their running mates, and their surrogates are pushing to shore up support before Election Day.

According to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls, Harris’s lead over Trump has narrowed in the election’s final stretch.

She holds a narrow lead of just one percentage point over the Republicans, 44 percent to 43 percent, nationally, according to the poll. The poll had a margin of error of approximately three percentage points in either direction.

The poll also indicates that Harris’s lead has steadily declined since late September. A previous Reuters/Ipsos poll from October 16-21 showed Harris leading Trump by two points.

A separate telephone and online poll by prominent US pollster Rasmussen suggests Harris faces a likability challenge. According to the survey, 47 percent of likely US voters view her favourably, with 33 percent holding a “very” favourable opinion. However, 51 percent view her unfavourably, and 44 percent have a “very” unfavourable impression.

National polls show Harris leading by 1.4 points according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll tracker – again, well within the margin of error of polls.

In swing states – the key battlegrounds likely to determine the outcome of the election – the race remains even tighter .

Those seven states include Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada.

FiveThirtyEight’s daily poll tracker shows Harris maintaining a slim lead in Michigan, and a razor-thin advantage in Nevada and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump holds a slight advantage over Harris in Pennsylvania and has a more significant lead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia.

In all seven states, the candidates are within two points of each other, well within the polls’ margins of error, leaving each state a toss-up just days before the final vote.

What was Kamala Harris up to on Sunday?

In what her campaign billed as a final appeal to voters, Harris delivered a speech from the Ellipse in Washington, DC.

“Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is, but America, I am here tonight to say that is not who we are,” Harris said.

A campaign official stated that the crowd at Harris’s rally exceeded 75,000 people, nearly four times the initial estimates.

Harris also reminded the crowd that this was the place where Trump sought to “overturn the will of the people” on January 6, 2021. That day saw thousands of supporters of then-President Trump storm the building in an effort to overturn his election defeat, forcing legislators to flee for safety.

“Tonight, I will speak to everyone about the choice and the stakes in this election,” Harris said. “We know who Donald Trump is.

“He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”

Harris closed her argument speech telling voters they are “not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators”.

“The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised,” Harris said. “In seven days, we have the power, each of you has the power, to turn the page, and start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told,” she added. Harris’s supporters in Washington, DC, said they felt anxious with one week left before Election Day.

“I’m just ready for her to win this,” Bruce Purvis, 34, told Al Jazeera, adding that he thought the Democratic candidate had done well and not just presented herself as a counterpoint to Trump. “I appreciate that she focused on the issues and not just the shortcomings of her opponent,” he said.

“I care most about the people – her focus on the middle class has been what’s set her aside.”

What was Donald Trump up to on Monday?

Trump kicked off his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, with a brief message for voters: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” The crowd replied with a loud “No”.

“I’m asking you to be excited again … They have embarrassed us. Kamala has embarrassed us. She doesn’t have what it takes. I’m asking you to dream big again.”

He urged his supporters to “stand up and tell Kamala” next Tuesday that “You’re fired” – a reference to how Trump would end episodes of his reality TV show, The Apprentice.

Throughout his speech in Allentown, Trump included rhetoric targeting immigrants, at one point saying that the US had turned into a “giant garbage can” where countries like Venezuela send their criminals. “We’re going to protect our men, our women and our country,” he asserted.

“We’re hearing Donald Trump go back on his closing message, that essentially Kamala broke it [and] Donald Trump can fix it,” Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Allentown, Pennsylvania, said.

“He’s gone through a litany of things he believes Harris is responsible for, including inflation and a ‘border invasion’ and said all of that will end on day one,” Fisher added.

According to Fisher, Trump spoke to a crowd of between 10,000 and 12,000 people, and when addressing Harris’s rally, Trump said that “sometimes, they bus them in, and when it’s on video, they use artificial intelligence”.

Trump holds a narrow lead over Harris in Pennsylvania, according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll tracker.

What’s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?

Kamala Harris campaigns in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin

Harris and Trump will both visit North Carolina – another battleground state – on Wednesday.

In North Carolina, Trump holds a significant edge over Harris.

With less than a week to go before the election, Harris is focused on conveying her message in key swing states. In addition to North Carolina, she will be visiting Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

However, experts believe that some of her arguments may not be compelling enough to resonate with all audiences.

One of her key messages is that Trump’s win could be a threat to democracy in the US, and experts believe this might not be compelling enough.

“I don’t think that the argument that Trump is a fascist and anti-democratic will move many voters … when you look at the data, most Americans are prioritising other issues. About 60 to 70 percent of Americans think that democracy is somehow at risk, but if you look at what issues they place as the most important, what’s going to drive their vote, it’s less than 3 percent that list democracy,” Thomas Gift, associate professor of political science at the University College London School of Public Policy, told Al Jazeera.

“If she wants to get the swing votes she is going to have to appeal based on the abortion issue in which the Democrats have a very considerable advantage, on the economy, sort of pushing back at Trump’s charges that this current administration is responsible for the cost of living crisis, on immigration to make sure that she can put forth the compelling case, for example, about how she’s going to deal the with the challenges at the border,” he added.

Trump, meanwhile, has claimed that Harris “has abandoned North Carolina families”.

“Trump will put an end to this madness when he returns to the White House. He has a proven track record of economic success from his first term, and he will put more money in people’s pockets as the 47th President of the United States,” his website reads.

He will also be in Wisconsin, holding a rally in Green Bay. Harris leads Trump marginally in the state, according to the poll tracker.","US election: 6 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/us-election-6-days-left-what-polls-say-what-harris-and-trump-are-up
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,Exploring Internet traffic shifts and cyber attacks during the 2024 US election - The Cloudflare Blog,"12 min read

Elections are not just a matter of casting ballots. They depend on citizens being able to register to vote and accessing information about candidates and the election process, which in turn depend on the strength and security of the Internet. Despite the risks posed by potential cyberattacks aimed to disrupt democracy, Cloudflare did not observe any significant disruptions to campaigns or local government websites from cyberattack.

Tuesday, November 5, 2024 was Election Day in the United States . It not only decided the next president and vice president but also included elections for the US Senate, House of Representatives, state governorships, and state legislatures. Results confirm that Republican Donald Trump won the presidential election.

In this blog post, we examine online attacks against election-related sites — some of which were notable but none were disruptive — and how initial election results impacted Internet traffic across the US at both national and state levels, with increases in traffic as much as 15% nationwide. We’ll also explore email phishing trends and general DNS data around news interest, the candidates, and election-related activity.

We’ve been tracking 2024 elections globally through our blog and election report on Cloudflare Radar , covering some of the more than 60 national elections around the globe this year. At Cloudflare, we support many of these efforts to ensure a secure and trustworthy election process. We worked closely with election officials, government agencies, and civil society groups across the country to ensure that groups working in the election space had the tools they needed to stay online.

Regarding the US elections, we have previously reported on trends surrounding the first Biden vs. Trump debate , the attempted assassination of Trump and the Republican National Convention , the Democratic National Convention , and the Harris-Trump presidential debate .

Key takeaways:

In the 24 hour period from October 31 - November 1, Cloudflare automatically mitigated over 6 billion HTTP DDoS requests that targeted US election-related websites–such as state and local government election sites and political campaigns. There were no significant disruptions to the targeted websites during this time period.

The day before the election, DNS traffic to Trump/Republican and Harris/Democrat websites peaked, with daily DNS traffic rising 59% and 4% respectively.

On election day, states in the midwest saw the highest traffic growth across the US, as compared to the previous week.

Internet traffic in the US peaked after the first polling stations closed, with a 15% increase over the previous week.

DNS traffic to news, polling, and election websites also saw large traffic jumps. Polling services were up 756% near poll closures and news sites were up 325% by late evening.

How Cloudflare assists with election infrastructure

Cloudflare’s goal is to ensure that sites that enable democracy — such as voter registration sites, election information portals, campaign websites, and results reporting platforms — remain secure and accessible, especially under heavy traffic periods or cyberattacks. Through our Impact programs, we provide essential cybersecurity resources to more than 800 websites that work on election infrastructure.

Project Galileo : Launched in 2014, Project Galileo provides free Business level services to media organizations, human rights defenders and non-profit organizations around the world. We protect more than 65 Internet properties related to elections in the United States that work on a range of topics related to voting rights, promoting free and fair elections, and posting election results. These organizations include Vote America , Decision Desk HQ , US Vote Foundation , and Electionland .

Athenian Project : Launched in 2017, the Athenian Project provides state and local governments that run elections with free Enterprise level services to ensure that voters can access accurate and up-to-date information about voter registration, polling places, and election results without interruption. We currently protect 423 websites in 33 states under the project.

Cloudflare for Campaigns : Launched in 2020, in partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns , Cloudflare for Campaigns provides a package of products to address the increasing risks posed by cyberattacks on political campaigns and state parties. We currently protect more than 354 campaigns and 34 state-level political parties in the United States.

Since 2020, we’ve strengthened our partnerships with election officials, government agencies, and nonprofits to provide essential protections. Throughout 2024, we’ve collaborated with CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative , briefing over 300 election officials on emerging threats and conducting 50+ calls with state and local governments to review security practices. Additionally, we held webinars on cyber threats to election groups and strategies for protecting election infrastructure.

With Defending Digital Campaigns, we worked to onboard more than 90 campaigns and parties weeks before election day. As part of this, we also worked with political vendors managing campaign infrastructure to provide insight on emerging threats and how to mitigate. Under Project Galileo, we onboarded more than 60 local media and journalism sites reporting on elections to ensure they can provide timely, accurate information on voting processes, candidate platforms, and election results.

Political and election-related cyber attacks

As we've seen several times this year, specific DDoS ( Distributed Denial of Service ) attacks often target political party or candidate websites around election day. While online attacks are frequent and not always election-related, we saw recent DDoS incidents in France , the Netherlands , and the U.K. focused on political parties during election periods.

In the US, we saw a similar uptick in attacks immediately prior to the election. Cloudflare blocked cyberattacks targeting websites affiliated with both parties, attempting to take the sites offline. Although some attacks had high volumes of traffic, the targeted websites remained online.

DDoS attacks targeting US political or elections-related Internet properties in particular clearly picked up starting in September, with the more than 6 billion HTTP DDoS requests seen during the first six days of November exceeding the volume seen during all of September and October.

Some campaign websites drove most of the malicious HTTP request traffic as part of DDoS attacks, with a clear increase since October 1, compared to minimal DDoS activity earlier in 2024.

Let’s look at a few examples of specific DDoS attacks, as these are easier to track.

High-profile campaign website, October 29 - November 6

Cloudflare blocked a series of DDoS attacks targeting a high-profile campaign website. The attacks began on October 29, with a four-minute spike reaching 345,000 requests per second. On October 31, more intense attacks followed, with the first lasting over an hour, peaking at 213,000 requests per second. Hours later, on November 1, a larger attack reached 700,000 requests per second, followed by two more waves at 311,000 and 205,000 requests per second.

Over 16 hours, Cloudflare blocked more than 6 billion malicious HTTP requests between October 31 and November 1. Additional attacks continued on November 3, with peaks at 200,000 requests per second (rps); on November 4, at 352,000; on Election Day, November 5, at 271,000 around 14:33 ET (11:33 PT); and on November 6, at 108,000.

Our data shows that the attacker(s) randomized user agents, attempted cache-busting techniques (methods to bypass cached content and overload servers with unique requests), and employed a geodiverse approach.

The DDoS attack on November 1 reached peak bandwidth of over 16 Gbps sent to Cloudflare and maintained over 8 Gbps throughout the main attack, which lasted more than two hours.

US campaign infrastructure website, November 3

Attackers also expanded their attacks beyond campaign sites, to political parties and their infrastructure, attempting — unsuccessfully — to disrupt services. For example, on November 3, 2024, a DDoS attack targeted infrastructure associated with a major campaign, lasting two minutes and reaching 260,000 malicious HTTP requests per second.

US state political party, October 29

On October 29, 2024, a high-volume DDoS attack targeted a U.S. political party website from a specific state. The attack lasted over four hours, from 12:00 to 17:29 ET (09:00 to 14:29 PT), and peaked at 206,000 requests per second. In total, over 2 billion malicious HTTP requests were blocked that day as part of this DDoS attack.

The same method used in the November 1 attack on one of the main campaign websites, mentioned above, was also used in this case. Here, the DDoS attack reached a peak of 5.7 Gbps sent to Cloudflare by the attacker, and sustained over 3 Gbps for most of its four-and-a-half-hour duration.

US counties as a target, September 13

Since September, US state and local websites protected by Cloudflare under the Athenian Project have experienced increased DDoS attacks, particularly targeting specific counties. These types of sites have seen over 290 million malicious HTTP requests since September 1, with 4% of all requests blocked as threats. These attacks were less frequent and intense than those on US political campaigns infrastructure.

On September 13, 2024, a DDoS attack targeted a county website from 19:29 UTC to 22:32 UTC (15:29 to 18:32 ET), lasting three hours and peaking at 46,000 of malicious HTTP requests per second.

These rates of DDoS attacks are already significant, even more so when we compare it with the 2020 US presidential election. In 2020, we saw more varied blocked cyberattack HTTP requests, split between WAF (Web Application Firewall) and firewall rules, and DDoS attacks. There were also significantly fewer blocked requests related to DDoS and WAF, with nearly 100 million in the whole month of October 2020 and close to 25 million in November 2020, the month of the election. In contrast, during November 1-6, 2024, alone, we observed over 6 billion malicious HTTP requests in DDoS attacks targeting campaigns.

It’s also important to note that even smaller attacks can be devastating for websites not well-protected against such high levels of traffic. DDoS attacks not only overwhelm systems but also serve, if successful, as a distraction for IT teams while attackers attempt other types of breaches.

Internet traffic in the US grows after polls closed

Generally, election days do not lead to drastic changes in Internet traffic. Traffic usually slightly dips during voting hours, though not as sharply as on national holidays, and rises in the evening as results are announced.

In the US, a similar pattern was observed on November 5, 2024, with increased Internet traffic at night. However, traffic throughout the day was generally 6% higher than the previous week, starting as early as 09:15 ET (06:15 PT). This may also be because, unlike in other countries, Election Day in the US is on a weekday rather than a weekend and is not a national holiday. Internet traffic peaked after the first polls closed, around 21:15 ET (18:15 PT), as TV news stations displayed countdown clocks. At that moment, traffic was 15% higher than the previous week.

Note: The previous 7 days line that appears in the next chart is one hour behind due to the Daylight Saving Time change over the weekend in the US. All growth calculations in this post take that change into account.

The biggest spike in traffic growth (compared to the previous week) of Election Day occurred at around 01:30 am ET (22:30 PT), when projections began to favor Trump for the presidential victory and Fox News called Pennsylvania in his favor, with traffic rising 32% compared to the previous week. Later, during Donald Trump's speech between 02:30 and 02:45 am ET (23:30 and 23:45 PT), Internet traffic was 31% higher than the previous week.

On Election Day, daily Internet traffic in the US reached its highest level of 2024 in terms of requests, showing a 6% increase compared to the previous week.

As expected for a typical election day, considering what we observed in other countries, the share of traffic from mobile devices was also slightly higher on Election Day at 43%, compared to 42% the previous week.

State-level traffic growth peaks at 21:00 ET (18:00 PT)

State-level traffic shifts on Election Day, compared to the previous week, reveal more detail than country-level data. The map below highlights the biggest traffic changes, peaking at 21:00 ET (18:00 PT) after polling stations began to close. Notably, traffic increased nationwide and at the state level on Election Day, unlike during the two-hour presidential debates, which were broadcast on nationwide TV.

The most significant traffic increases were observed in Maine (44%), South Dakota (44%), and Montana (44%). Interestingly, central states saw higher percentages of Internet traffic growth than coastal ones. More populous states, such as California (8%), Texas (19%), New York (22%), and Florida (23%), also experienced notable traffic increases.

The seven swing states that are considered to have been decisive in the election — Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (we’re not considering Arizona due to data issues) — each saw traffic growth between 17% and 36%. Here’s a more focused view of those swing states for easier consumption:

State Growth in traffic Local time (in each state) Georgia 25% 21:15 Michigan 34% 21:15 Nevada 17% 18:15 North Carolina 14% 21:15 Pennsylvania 33% 21:15 Wisconsin 36% 20:15

DNS trends: from news outlets to polling services

Switching our focus to domain trends, our 1.1.1.1 resolver DNS data reveals a clear impact during the US elections when analyzing specific categories.

Analysis of DNS traffic for US news media outlets shows that traffic from the United States rose significantly right after 09:00 ET (06:00 PT), increasing around 15%, compared to the previous week. Traffic continued to climb throughout the day, peaking between 22:00 and 23:00 ET (19:00 and 20:00 PT) with DNS request traffic volume 325% higher than the previous week. There was also a brief spike on Wednesday, November 6, at 05:00 ET (02:00 PT), showing a 117% increase.

We observed significantly higher DNS traffic for polling services websites — websites of platforms or organizations that conduct and publish polls — on Election Day, peaking at 13:00 ET (10:00 PT) with a 206% increase from the previous week, and again at 22:00 ET (19:00 PT), after the polls started to close, with a 756% increase. Daily traffic to this category was up 145% on Election Day, and 36% the day prior.

Election and voting information-related websites also saw a notable rise in DNS traffic around Election Day. Traffic clearly began to increase the day before the election, and peaked on November 5, 2024, at 12:00 ET (09:00 PT), with a 313% increase from the previous week. Daily traffic was 139% higher on Election Day, and 68% higher the day before.

Social media sites/applications, especially microblogging platforms like X and Threads, were also impacted during Election Day.

From a cybersecurity perspective, trending events , topics, and individuals often attract more emails, including malicious, phishing, and spam messages. Our earlier analysis covered email trends involving “Joe Biden” and “Donald Trump” since January. We’ve since updated it to include Kamala Harris after the Democratic Convention and the Harris-Trump debate .

From June 1 through November 4, 2024, Cloudflare’s Cloud Email Security service processed over 19 million emails with “Donald Trump” or “Kamala Harris” in the subject line — 13.9 million for Trump and 5.3 million for Harris. Nearly half of these emails (49%) were sent since September. In the last 10 days of the campaign (since October 24), Harris was named in 800,000 email subject lines and Trump in 1.3 million.

Since June 1, 12% of emails mentioning Trump were marked as spam, and 1.3% were flagged as malicious or phishing. This rate has dropped since September 1, with only 3% marked as spam and 0.3% as malicious. For emails mentioning Harris, the rates were lower: 0.6% were marked as spam and 0.2% as malicious since June, increasing slightly to 1.2% spam and 0.2% malicious since September 1. Trump was mentioned more frequently in email subjects than Harris and was found in higher overall percentages of spam and malicious emails.

Trump's victory dims the hopes of Arizona Democrats, who sought to continue their ascendance, which began with the 2018 flip of a longtime GOP-held Senate seat and continued in 2020 and 2022. Biden was the second Democrat to win Arizona in 70 years.

Historic comeback

Trump sealed a historic comeback to the White House in the November 5 election, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of US politics overshadowed by his hardline, disruptive right-wing politics. The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a ""fascist.""

Exit polls showed that voters' top concern remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the Covid pandemic.

""It's a political victory that our country has never seen before."" As supporters chanted ""USA!"", the 78-year-old added that his ""magnificent"" win would ""allow us to make America great again.""

The Associated Press called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin for Trump, and he led the Democratic vice president in the others although they have not been called yet. Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a non-consecutive second term.

World leaders rushed to congratulate him before the final results were in, with Ukraine's president in particular urging Trump to help achieve a ""just peace"" against Russia.

Vice President Harris, who only entered the race in July after President Joe Biden dropped out, ran a centrist campaign that highlighted Trump's inflammatory messaging and use of openly racist and sexist tropes.

Gloom swiftly descended on Harris's camp as she canceled a watch party for supporters who dreamed of seeing her elected as America's first woman president. ""You won't hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow,"" Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co-chair, told a watch party in Washington as supporters left.

In a further blow to Democrats, Trump's Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority.

As Trump's jubilant supporters cheered and chanted ""USA,"" Trump took to the stage along with his wife Melania and several of his children as he neared the cusp of victory. ""We made history,"" he said, speaking against a backdrop of Stars and Stripes flags, adding that ""we are going to help our country heal."" He also referenced the two assassination attempts he escaped during the campaign, adding: ""Many people have told me that God has spared my life for a reason."" Trump was joined at his watch party by key supporters including tech tycoon Elon Musk, the world's richest man. He called the X and Tesla boss a ""new star"" in a shout-out from the podium.

Polls for weeks had shown a knife-edge race between Harris and the twice-impeached Trump, who would be the oldest ever president at the time of inauguration, the first felon president and only the second in history to serve non-consecutive terms. Trump also faces sentencing in a criminal case over hush money payments on November 26, while the controversy over his unprecedented attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden still persists. But in the end, the night was over surprisingly soon.

Trump to win the popular vote

Trump even appeared to be nearing victory in the popular vote – something he never achieved in his 2016 victory or in 2020.

Harris on the other hand appeared to have underperformed in key areas, with Trump winning support among Latinos and Black men. Trump's promises of economic bounty and his dark rhetoric on migrants also appear to have resonated with voters who were tired of Biden and Harris's administration.

"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,The Electoral College and Our Broken Presidential Election System - Ash Center,"Near the close of their speeches at the Democratic National Convention, both Michelle and Barack Obama exhorted their listeners to actively support the Harris campaign, to “work like our lives depend on it.” Former President Obama declared, “If we each do our part over the next 77 days, if we knock on doors, if we make phone calls, if we talk to our friends, if we listen to our neighbors . . . we will elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.” “Do something,” asked the former First Lady, “you know what you need to do.”

But there was and is a problem with the Obamas’ urgent call to action: the roughly 80 percent of the population who do not live in “swing states” lack a clear notion of what they “need to do” to actively support their candidates. In those “sure states” (as they once were labeled), there is little to be gained, for either Democrats or Republicans, in knocking on doors, conversing with neighbors, calling people in nearby towns and cities, or putting up yard signs. The few steps that non-swing state citizens can take – writing checks or joining a phone bank to cold call swing state voters – offer little of the satisfaction or sense of solidarity that can come from in-person participation in a political cause.

The reason for this, of course, is our deeply flawed electoral system, in particular the practice in 48 states of awarding all of a state’s electoral votes to the candidate who wins that state’s popular vote. That practice sequesters most of us, deterring us from becoming fully active, from learning by engaging our fellow citizens and participating in the processes of democracy. Both political parties insist that this is the most important election of our lifetimes, but most Americans are mere spectators, sitting in front of screens watching the campaign unfold in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, or Arizona.

“Winner take all” (WTA) also makes it more likely that the candidate who loses the popular vote can still win the electoral vote and become President – an outcome that violates basic democratic principles. Moreover, the system depresses voter turnout and leads to the quadrennial emphasis on issues that matter most to swing states – not to mention the extra monies that tend to flow to swing states between elections.

Why do we have this system? It’s not mandated by the Constitution. The framers left it to the states to decide how to allocate electoral votes, although most of them appear to have expected the states to adopt district-based systems. For the first decade or so, many states did allocate electoral votes by district (often congressional districts), while others deployed WTA (then called the “general ticket”) or allowed their legislatures to choose electors without even holding a popular election. WTA then took root in more states for largely partisan reasons: political majorities in individual states wanted to guarantee that their candidate would win all of the state’s electoral votes. Virginia famously took this step in the hotly contested election of 1800 to prevent John Adams from winning even a few electoral votes. The shift was so unprincipled that Virginian John Marshall, on the brink of becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, declared that he would never vote for President again while WTA remained in place.

Indeed, WTA was widely disparaged throughout the early decades of our history. Four times between 1813 and 1826, the Senate approved constitutional amendments to require district elections; on one occasion the House fell only a few votes short of the required two-thirds vote that would have sent the amendment to the states to be ratified. Some of the Constitution’s framers themselves, including James Madison, favored prohibition of WTA. North Carolina Representative James Strudwick Smith argued that a district system would “give the minority as well as the majority of the people of every state a chance of being heard. . . . You will bring the election near to the people and consequently, you will make them place more value on the elective franchise.”

Efforts to eliminate WTA have recurred for the last two centuries. Michigan adopted a district system in the 1890s, as Maine and Nebraska have done more recently; Republicans and Democrats in numerous states have seriously considered taking that bold step in both the 20th and 21st centuries. Meanwhile, Congress periodically debated amending the Constitution to require the allocation of electoral votes either by districts or through a proportional system in which a candidate’s electoral vote would match their percentage of the popular vote. In 1950, the Senate approved an amendment calling for a proportional system; in 1969, the House passed an amendment that would have replaced the Electoral College with a national popular vote – which also, of course, would have eliminated WTA.

The historical record thus makes clear that widespread dissatisfaction with WTA is not a modern phenomenon: it is as venerable as the Constitution itself. Reform efforts nonetheless have met with limited success, thanks to the primacy of ever-shifting partisan interests that overrode democratic values or beliefs about how a presidential election should work. It is difficult to conjure up a principled rationale for an electoral system that not only discards the votes of political minorities but effectively adds them to the winner’s total.

Can anything be done? Individual states could join Nebraska and Maine in adopting systems that better suit the political diversity of their populations. But history suggests that such a strategy will not get very far. Parties with reliable majorities in each state have had little interest in diminishing the electoral payoff that comes with winning the state; and politicians of both parties have been reluctant to reduce their states’ Electoral College influence by acting as first movers, however principled such a decision might be. California will not abandon WTA while Texas retains it. And ongoing efforts to adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would require participating states to award all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, face difficult hurdles.

The more plausible, and durable, strategy would be a constitutional amendment requiring states to allocate their electoral votes utilizing some type of proportional scheme. Alternatively, a constitutional amendment providing for a national popular vote would achieve the same result. (Despite their success in Maine and Nebraska, district systems will remain problematic as long as partisan gerrymandering is widespread and legal.) Constitutional reform that modifies or replaces the Electoral College would also provide an opportunity to rid ourselves of the deeply undemocratic – and hazardous – “contingent” election system. Currently, if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives selects the President, with each state’s delegation (no matter how large or small) casting one vote. Although not utilized since 1824, the contingent system – which has the rare distinction of having been denounced by both Thomas Jefferson and Mitch McConnell – is a ticking bomb, set to explode during a close election.

The task of Electoral College reform is daunting. Since the 1970s, the mere mention of reform has often elicited responses of weary pessimism even among those who favor the idea. Our Constitution is notoriously difficult to amend, and Republicans reflexively oppose reform because they currently believe that the Electoral College works in their favor. The polarization and inflammatory rhetoric of contemporary politics make cooperation, and even discussion, difficult.

But that does not mean we should continue to accept an undemocratic system that was created more than 200 years ago, itself a product of partisanship and gamesmanship. Since the 1940s (when the first reliable polls were taken), a majority of the American people has favored Electoral College reform or abolition; we have come close to altering the system on multiple occasions; and partisan perceptions of advantage have commonly shifted over time. Change will be hard but not impossible.

No reform, of course, will happen between now and November; voters will focus on more immediate issues through Election Day and likely into January. But no matter the outcome of this year’s election, the challenges facing American democracy will persist, and among them is the task of doing something about a presidential election system that dampens engagement and turnout, deforms the conduct of campaigns, and fails to match democratic values. Surely we can do better – and have a national conversation about how to do so. Just imagine how very different the current campaign would look if every vote, in every state, really did count.",The Electoral College and Our Broken Presidential Election System  Ash Center,Ash Center,https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-electoral-college-and-our-broken-presidential-election-system/

How are citizens and leaders in other parts of the world viewing this election? What’s at stake for their countries and regions?

This was the focus of “The 2024 US Presidential Election: The World is Watching,” a Starr Forum held earlier this month on the MIT campus.

The Starr Forum is a public event series hosted by MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS), and focused on leading issues of global interest. The event was moderated by Evan Lieberman, director of CIS and the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa.

Experts in African, Asian, European, and Latin American politics assembled to share ideas with one another and the audience.

Each offered informed commentary on their respective regions, situating their observations within several contexts including the countries’ style of government, residents’ perceptions of American democratic norms, and America’s stature in the eyes of those countries’ populations.

Perceptions of U.S. politics from across the globe

Katrina Burgess, professor of political economy at Tufts University and the director of the Henry J. Leir Institute of Migration and Human Security, sought to distinguish the multiple political identities of members of the Latin American diaspora in America and their perceptions of America’s relationship with their countries.

“American democracy is no longer perceived as a standard bearer,” Burgess said. “While members of these communities see advantages in aligning themselves with one of the presidential candidates because of positions on economic relations, immigration, and border security, others have deeply-held views on fossil fuels and increased access to sustainable energy solutions.”

Prerna Singh, Brown University’s Mahatma Gandhi Professor of Political Science and International Studies, spoke about India’s status as the world’s largest democracy and described a country moving away from democratic norms.

“Indian leaders don’t confer with the press,” she said. “Indian leaders don’t debate like Americans.”

The ethnically and linguistically diverse India, Singh noted, has elected several women to its highest government posts, while the United States has yet to elect one. She described a brand of “exclusionary nationalism” that threatened to move India away from democracy and toward something like authoritarian rule.

John Githongo, the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellow at CIS for 2024-25, shared his findings on African countries’ views of the 2024 election.

“America’s soft power infrastructure in Africa is crumbling,” said Githongo, a Kenyan native. “Chinese investment in Africa is up significantly and China is seen by many as an ideal political and economic partner.”

Youth-led protests in Kenya, Githongo noted, occurred in response to a failure of promised democratic reforms. He cautioned against a potential return to a pre-Cold War posture in Africa, noting that the Biden administration was the first in some time to attempt to reestablish economic and political ties with African countries.

Daniel Ziblatt, the Eaton Professor of Government at Harvard University and the director of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, described shifting political winds in Europe that appear similar to increased right-wing extremism and a brand of populist agitation being observed in America.

“We see the rise of the radical, antidemocratic right in Europe and it looks like shifts we’ve observed in the U.S.,” he noted. “Trump supporters in Germany, Poland, and Hungary are increasingly vocal.”

Ziblatt acknowledged the divisions in the historical transatlantic relationship between Europe and America as symptoms of broader challenges. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, energy supply issues, and national security apparatuses dependent on American support may continue to cause political ripples, he added.

Does America still have global influence?

Following each of their presentations, the guest speakers engaged in a conversation, taking questions from the audience. There was agreement among panelists that there’s less investment globally in the outcome of the U.S. election than may have been observed in past elections.

Singh noted that, from the perspective of the Indian media, India has bigger fish to fry.

Panelists diverged, however, when asked about the rise of political polarization and its connection with behaviors observed in American circles.

“This trend is global,” Burgess asserted. “There’s no causal relationship between American phenomena and other countries’ perceptions.”

“I think they’re learning from each other,” Ziblatt countered when asked about extremist elements in America and Europe. “There’s power in saying outrageous things.”

Githongo asserted a kind of “trickle-down” was at work in some African countries.

“Countries with right-leaning governments see those inclinations make their way to organizations like evangelical Christians,” he said. “Their influence mirrors the rise of right-wing ideology in other African countries and in America.”

Singh likened the continued splintering of American audiences to India’s caste system.

“I think where caste comes in is with the Indian diaspora,” she said. “Indian-American business and tech leaders tend to hail from high castes.” These leaders, she said, have outsized influence in their American communities and in India.",How is the world watching the 2024 US election?

"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 16:09:04 GMT",US elections,2024 US election: Potential implications for portfolios - Mercer,"The policy platforms of the two major candidates present stark contrasts, particularly in the areas of taxation, regulation, and trade, which could have varying consequences for the broader economy and financial markets.

Vice President Harris has articulated plans to expand social service programs, cancel additional student loan debt, and pursue reductions in drug prices. These initiatives are complemented by proposed tax increases on corporate, individual, and capital gains income. While these tax measures may reduce household disposable income, the associated spending on social programs may help offset some of the potential economic drag.

In the near term, the market impact of Harris's policies is expected to be modest as they represent a continuation of the current administration’s policies. Her trade stance, which includes maintaining tariffs on Chinese goods and possibly raising tariffs on strategic sectors, could marginally increase inflation but is unlikely to result in significant economic or market impact.

Former President Trump’s platform, by contrast, features more aggressive and potentially market-moving proposals. His plans include reducing corporate taxes, potentially to as low as 15%, which would likely provide a substantial boost to corporate earnings and equity markets. Additionally, his regulatory approach is expected to be more lenient, further supporting business interests and potentially stimulating economic growth.

However, his stance on trade, particularly his proposal to impose additional tariffs on imports from China and other countries, could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and diminished business confidence. These protectionist measures, while intended to bolster domestic industries, may strengthen the U.S. dollar, undermining the competitive advantages that the tariffs are designed to achieve. Trump's desire to exert more influence over the Federal Reserve also poses a potential risk to market confidence, particularly if such actions were perceived to threaten the central bank's independence.",2024 US election: Potential implications for portfolios  Mercer,Mercer,https://www.mercer.com/en-us/insights/investments/market-outlook-and-trends/us-election/
"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,How the U.S. election could impact the healthcare industries - Clarivate,"Healthcare delivery has not been the hottest topic on the campaign trail this election season, despite sharp policy differences between the candidates and parties. However, issues such as drug pricing, the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, M&A and telehealth are still worth watching as significant changes could be on the horizon regardless of who wins in November.

These are several key threads to watch:

The 2024 election may determine the future of IRA price negotiations

The outcome of November’s Presidential and Congressional elections could well determine the extent to which the federal government will continue its gradual encroachment into negotiations for drug prices under Medicare’s Part B and Part D programs.

Since the government first created a Part D benefit with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), Democrats have agitated for greater governmental input into the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA placed price negotiations for Part D drugs under private plans, resulting in contracting between manufacturers and payers with rebates accruing to payers, not the government. The Inflation Reduction Act instead allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to begin negotiating Fair Maximum Prices for a growing list of Part D (outpatient) and Part B (physician-administered) drugs that represent the greatest cost to the federal government.

In 2023, CMS selected the first 10 Part D drugs and the ensuing negotiations resulted in the MFPs for these 10 drugs being 59% below their current list prices, a Clarivate analysis found. Over the next five years, CMS is slated to select up to 90 additional Medicare Part B and Part D drugs for price negotiation as highlighted in the figure below.

Parties disagree on role of government in price negotiations.

Before the second batch of drugs for negotiations are selected, Americans will head to the polls to elect a President and Congress. Vice President Harris, who cast the tie-breaking vote in support if the IRA, has pledged to “accelerate the negotiations to cover more drugs and lower prices.” In public speeches, she has suggested possibly expanding the program beyond Medicare, presumably to the commercial insurance market (covering 47% of all lives in the U.S.). Such a change would sharply increase the number of people covered under this program.

Former President Trump , whose platform calls healthcare and prescription drug costs “out of control,” has not spoken on whether the price negotiations under Medicare would remain the law. However, recommendations from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 could influence policymaking under a Trump administration. This conservative think-tank has criticized the price negotiations and called for its repeal in favor of other insurance design reforms.

With control of Congress and the Presidency up for grabs, the IRA price negotiation program’s future is likely to be decided next month.

The Affordable Care Act

The Harris plan for healthcare pulls back from the vice president’s previous support of a Medicare-for-all system and seeks to build on Obamacare and enhancements passed during the Biden administration. With pieces of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare reforms still rolling out, a potential Harris presidency would oversee their implementation.

The Trump administration platform does not bring up the ACA. At campaign events, Trump has said he will keep Obamacare unless he could replace it with something better. During the Sept. 10 debate, Trump returned to repeal and replace rhetoric, offering that he has “concepts of a plan”. A coherent Republic healthcare strategy could lean on a proposal from the Republican study committee, which would reduce exchange subsidies and seek to convert Medicaid to block grant funding, both longtime ideas in circulation among the Republican caucus that would likely reduce services and enrolment. Georgia’s implementation of a partial ACA Medicaid expansion with an employment requirement could see renewed interest if Trump returns to the White House — many states explored or instituted work requirements during his previous term.

The immediate issue for whoever wins will be expanded subsidies extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Loss of subsidies could cause spikes in insurance premiums and major losses in exchange enrolment. Extending them would require Congressional action. Congressional Democrats introduced legislation to make the subsidies permanent in September 2024, but the legislation has no chance of passage so close to the election. A Republican sweep of both chambers would imperil the expanded subsidies, although an expansion could conceivably pass as part of a larger “must-pass” spending bill. The issue will await November’s victors and could affect tens of millions of Americans and their health coverage.

Medicare Advantage

While a Harris administration would not push Medicare-for-All, which the candidate once supported, it will likely continue on the same path as the Biden administration, which still has several phases of drug pricing negotiations to unfurl, with additional drugs – as well as Part B drug negotiations – coming online through 2029. A second Trump administration would like face pushback if it abandoned or overturned the drug-pricing reforms of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes numerous pieces that will prove popular with seniors, even as the industry faces price negotiations on top drugs, long an industry non-starter. It would be hard to pull back key reforms such as a $35 monthly insulin cap and an annual $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum, which beneficiaries can spread over a 12-month period.

Medicare is likely to experience significant churn in 2025, as top payers pull back plan options and even leave some counties. Given the Trump administration push for Medicare Advantage plans, which successfully raised the MA share of all Medicare enrolments above 50 %, there could be a renewed focus on supplementary benefits and other enticements for beneficiaries if Trump returns to office. The popularity of Medicare Advantage makes it difficult to cut too deeply despite impacts from the program, so future changes will likely continue to be slight under either Harris or Trump.

Consolidation and M&A

Another obvious policy divergence between Harris and Trump is that of regulating mergers and acquisitions that accelerate concentration in the industry.

As California Attorney General from 2011 to 2017, Harris was a forceful opponent of healthcare industry consolidation, both vertical and horizontal, believing that mergers of hospitals, physician groups and insurers would damage competition and raise prices for care. As AG, she joined a federal lawsuit to block Anthem and Cigna’s merger in 2016 .

These prior actions align with the Biden Administration’s policy of strict antitrust enforcement, particularly concerning healthcare.

By contrast, the Trump Administration took a more laissez-faire approach to consolidation in the healthcare arena, both vertical and horizontal. It allowed the largest healthcare merger in history – that of CVS and Aetna in 2018 – requiring only minimal divestment. It also allowed within-market hospital mergers in several major markets including Chicago, Twin Cities, Houston and Atlanta.

President Biden specifically focused on healthcare mergers in his July 2021 Executive Order directing rigorous enforcement of antitrust laws “to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony” in the hospital, insurance and prescription drug markets.

While the FTC remains hampered by a lack of resources, its investigations and regulatory stance alone has discouraged certain types of mergers, such as those of hospital systems within the same territory. The Biden FTC also has been more exacting in the types of conditions, or settlement agreements, that it will accept to approve deals, according to legal analysis by the firm Kirkland & Ellis .

It has had less success reining in the rapid consolidation across the healthcare industry’s segments: The Biden FTC and DOJ fought to prevent UnitedHealth Group’s purchase of Change Healthcare, but lost in court, for example.

But given her direct experience and activism in challenging mergers that appear to harm consumers’ access to affordable care, a Harris presidency could result in a renewed push against industry consolidation, testing emerging ideas in how to analyze and mitigate potential harms.

Other healthcare topics to watch:

Telehealth

About a dozen federal telehealth waivers put in place during the Covid pandemic are set to expire Dec. 31, 2024, and providers and payers are pushing for an extension. There are two ways telehealth waivers can be extended through 2025 – via The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Rule and legislatively through 2026 via H.R. 7623. Telehealth has proven its worth and would likely be extended under Harris or Trump, but it’s worth noting what’s at stake if the waivers expire and Congress and/or CMS doesn’t act.

Pre-waiver, for behavioral health visits, patients were required to have received an in-person evaluation six months before initiating telehealth, followed by an in-person visit annually. Under the waiver, in-person evaluation is no longer required for these consults.

Waivers enable access to medications for hundreds of thousands of patients nationwide for a variety of medical diagnoses including substance use disorder.

The waiver allows patients to be seen across geographic lines and in any setting.

As of Aug. 6, 2024, 43 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands have pay-parity laws in place that will not expire regardless of election outcomes.

Chevron Doctrine Overturned

Beyond the presidency, the ACA and IRA are likely to face bigger challenges from the courts as a result of a seismic U.S. Supreme Court decision nixing the “Chevron defense” of federal regulation, thereby opening those regulations up to legal challenges. The Chevron Doctrine, a longstanding legal precedent that required courts to defer to reasonable interpretation by federal agencies in carrying out laws passed by Congress, was overturned in June 2024 by the court.

The ruling is likely to impact the healthcare industries, particularly around FDA decision-making on drug approvals, drug labelling and dietary supplements. Increased legal challenges could make it difficult for the healthcare industry to rely on new FDA interpretations and guidance, but the impact may be muted– the Chevron doctrine hasn’t been cited in any Supreme Court cases for about a decade.

Key takeaways:

The election outcome may determine the extent to which the federal government will continue its gradual encroachment into negotiations for drug prices under Medicare’s Part B and Part D programs.

Harris would likely continue the Biden Administration’s M&A-dampening skepticism toward consolidation and negotiation of drug prices for Medicare recipients. The Trump administration took a more hands-off approach to M&A and would be unlikely to overturn drug pricing changes or key Biden Administration reforms, including a $35 monthly insulin cap.

Trump has changed positions repeatedly on whether he would attempt to overturn the ACA. Harris has been a staunch supporter of the ACA, despite her previous position in support of a single-payer “Medicare for All” scheme.

About a dozen federal telehealth waivers put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire Dec. 31, 2024, and providers and payers are pushing for an extension. Overturning the Chevron Doctrine will make it tougher for federal health agencies to cut through red tape but is unlikely to have a major immediate impact on policy and regulation.

Mr. Trump improved on his 2020 margin in 2,764 counties. His margin decreased in only 317 counties. There were 31 counties where too few votes had been counted to be included in the analysis.

In the two previous presidential elections, the shifts in key battleground states played a pivotal role in deciding the outcomes. In 2020, Mr. Biden won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, propelling him to victory. In 2016, Mr. Trump had won those same states by earning significant support across the industrial Midwest.

BBC

Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an “unprecedented and powerful” mandate to govern. He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall. Trump’s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda. He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history. But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting. His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a ""landslide"" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues. ""It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,"" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos. The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House. That is thanks to America’s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states. Here are three ways to look at his win.

Trump missed majority of voters by a hair

With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC’s US partner, CBS News. That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004. But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California. This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.

In 2024, Trump’s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago. But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall. To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016. For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate ""may be overwrought"", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to ""justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government"".

His electoral college win was resounding

On a different metric, Trump’s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris’s 226. And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one. The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college. Trump’s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984. And it is important to remember that the “winner takes all” mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph. What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?

Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote. If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide. In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable. But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender. Republicans win House in major boost for Trump

Second highest vote count - behind Biden in 2020

There is another measure with which to consider Trump’s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure. The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.

It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964. That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved. Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket. Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to ""2019 prices"" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze. ""The real story is Harris’s inability to mobilise people who voted for Biden in 2020,"" he said.",Just how big was Donald Trump’s election victory?

Millions of Americans are heading to the polls, entrusting their ballots with local poll workers. But what exactly these poll workers do – and the requirements they must meet to assume this role – varies widely by state and county.

Overall, U.S. registered voters tend to trust poll workers. Nine-in-ten registered voters say in a new Pew Research Center survey that they are at least somewhat confident that poll workers in their community will do a good job during this year’s elections. In fact, voters are more likely to express confidence in poll workers than in state officials who run elections (90% vs. 81%).

Large majorities of voters who back Vice President Kamala Harris and those who back former President Donald Trump express at least some confidence in poll workers. But Harris supporters are much more likely than Trump supporters to say they are very confident (62% vs. 36%). Harris supporters are also more likely than Trump supporters to be very confident in state election officials (43% vs. 20%).

Here are key facts about poll workers in the United States, including:

What do U.S. election workers do?

There are three types of election staff, but poll workers account for the bulk of them:

Poll workers are temporarily recruited to perform various duties on Election Day and the lead-up to it. Their duties can include setting up voting equipment, greeting or checking in voters, verifying voter IDs and registration, serving as language interpreters, counting ballots, and more. Poll workers hold different titles – such as election clerk, election judge, inspector, booth worker, warden or commissioner – depending on the state or county.

are elected, appointed or otherwise hired to carry out specialized activities like recruiting and training poll workers and maintaining voter rolls. They work year-round, and many have additional duties beyond election administration. Poll watchers are not typically government employees. They’re generally appointed by political parties to observe the opening of the polls and ballot counting. They may be party or candidate representatives, members of nonpartisan groups, academics, or part of special interest groups with stakes in local ballot measures.

How many poll workers usually help in general elections?

Looking at polling sites with available data, roughly 644,000 poll workers assisted with in-person and/or early voting in the 2022 general election. This includes data from 45 states and the District of Columbia collected by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), a study conducted every two years to examine how states administer federal elections.

Data was unavailable for New Hampshire, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as for the country’s two fully vote-by-mail states: Oregon and Washington. (Hawaii, which is included in these figures, primarily conducts voting by mail but still has in-person voting at staffed polling sites.)

By comparison, about 774,000 poll workers helped in the 2020 general election, according to EAVS data from polling sites that provided this information in 44 states and D.C. (This total excludes data from the same states as in the 2022 survey, as well as Pennsylvania.)

Related: Republicans, Democrats continue to differ sharply on voting access

Which states have the most poll workers per polling site?

D.C. topped the list with 23 poll workers per site in the 2022 general election. Colorado (15 per polling place), Nevada (14), New York, Maryland and Minnesota (12 each) rounded out the top six.

In 2022, 28 of the 45 states and D.C. with available data had fewer than eight poll workers per site. (This total includes Iowa, but some jurisdictions there did not report the number of poll workers they had that year.)

Are poll workers paid?

The amount of compensation poll workers can receive varies widely by state and county. Minimum requirements are typically set on the state level – with some using the federal or state minimum wage as a basis – but local jurisdictions sometimes opt to pay their workers more.

While election clerks in Delaware are entitled to a $300 stipend, for example, many poll workers in Alaska are eligible to make $20 an hour. Colorado law requires election judges to be paid at least $5 per day.

Poll workers can also often be reimbursed for travel expenses or paid for completing trainings.

Several states, including New Jersey, Oklahoma and Alabama, have raised their minimum compensation requirements for poll workers in the past few years to incentivize more recruits. Most recently, South Carolina’s Election Commission requested a budget increase to fund a $40 daily raise for the Palmetto State’s poll workers.

What criteria must poll workers meet?

Across D.C. and the 48 states that have in-person voting, requirements vary widely – even for poll workers serving different roles in the same precinct. But some similarities emerge:

All states have minimum age requirements, most often set at 18, but many allow students as young as 16 to serve under certain limitations.

most often set at 18, but many allow students as young as 16 to serve under certain limitations. Forty-one states, plus D.C., explicitly require volunteers to be registered voters. In Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin, they must at least be eligible to vote.

In Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin, they must at least be eligible to vote. Every state but Hawaii – where voting primarily takes place by mail – has explicit residency requirements. States often mandate that poll workers reside in the county or precinct of the polling place, but many allow some flexibility for outsiders if there are volunteer shortages.

States often mandate that poll workers reside in the county or precinct of the polling place, but many allow some flexibility for outsiders if there are volunteer shortages. Poll workers are explicitly required to have a party affiliation in at least nine states. In about half of the 48 states that offer in-person voting, it’s “considered,” “preferred” or “generally” required unless there aren’t enough volunteers who affiliate with a major party. Some states – such as New York , for example – require poll workers or election officials to equally represent the two major political parties, depending on the worker’s position.

The vast majority of states require poll workers to undergo trainings, which are commonly held at the local level.

which are commonly held at the local level. At least 37 states, plus D.C., require at least some poll workers in certain positions to swear an oath.

Arkansas poll worker oath “We, the undersigned, do swear that we will perform the duties of poll workers of this election according to law and to the best of our abilities, and that we will studiously endeavor to prevent fraud, deceit, and abuse in conducting the same, and we will not disclose how any voter shall have voted, unless required to do so as a witness in a judicial proceeding or a proceeding to contest an election.”

Elected officials, candidates and their families, political action committee members, and people with felony records are typically barred from serving as poll workers. People who’ve bet on elections or committed certain crimes are also sometimes prohibited.

Some states also set additional “good reputation” requirements. For example, poll workers in Georgia must be “be judicious, intelligent, and upright citizens” while those in New Jersey must be “of good repute and character.” Virginia simply requires that they are “competent citizens.”

What are common recruitment challenges?

While Nebraska law allows counties to draft people – jury duty-style – to meet staffing needs, most U.S. poll workers are volunteers. With more than 94,000 polling sites to staff nationwide, recruiting enough people can be a challenge.

Specific hurdles, such as a lack of public awareness about the job or disinterest in the long hours and relatively low pay, have been widely cited by news outlets and research organizations. Public health was also a worrisome issue for poll workers – the majority of whom are older than 60 – during the 2020 election, which coincided with the coronavirus pandemic.

Personal safety concerns among poll workers also intensified that year and continue to linger. The Department of Justice recently warned that harassment against poll workers may persist – and potentially worsen with the use of AI – in the 2024 election. Many states have responded to these concerns, with 18 enacting legal protections for election officials and poll workers since 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Creative recruitment methods have subsequently cropped up in several states, such as enlisting military veterans for the job in the hopes of increasing public trust in poll workers. Election officials in places that allow younger workers have also recently pushed to mobilize college and high school students to volunteer at polling sites for the 2024 election.

"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,A look ahead: President Donald Trump’s second term - EY,"President Donald Trump will need to work with Congress to enact lasting change on many of these issues — he will benefit from Republican control of both chambers for at least the first two years of his term. The GOP controlled Senate will enable a smoother and swifter path to confirmation of Cabinet and other high-level political appointees (where a simple majority is needed) and thus a potentially quick start to implementing his policy agenda.

The GOP trifecta also could allow for more sweeping legislative change. Importantly with respect to tax policy, congressional procedures allow for passage by a simple majority in the Senate; so, even in a closely divided Congress, tax legislation is one priority that can advance with Republican control of Congress and the White House, as we saw in 2017. Some suggest the tax reform package, for example, could move within the first few months of the new Congress. Other Republican policy priorities would require some bipartisan cooperation because Republicans will not have the requisite votes.

Quick take: Trump’s approach to six key issues

1. Tax:

Expiration of many provisions in Trump’s signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will drive the debate in Congress early on — Trump supports a TCJA extension and an even lower corporate rate for some domestic corporations at 15%. The second Trump administration’s tax policy approach is likely to focus on preserving current rates, further reducing tax rates where possible, promoting onshoring and growing the US economy.

2. Trade and supply chains:

Trump’s second-term trade agenda will be driven by an “America First” posture and policy — prioritizing domestic and nearshoring efforts and broadly expanding tariffs.

3. Technology:

Tech, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), remains an important policy issue in Washington. Trump’s technology policy will be informed by the pursuit of free speech principles and is likely to be a custom-made approach, departing from President Joe Biden’s approach in many areas and driven by his administration’s interactions with big tech and social media platforms.",A look ahead: President Donald Trump’s second term  EY,EY,https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/public-policy/six-key-issues-for-2024-us-elections
"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,How Trump is preparing the ground to challenge the US election - FRANCE 24 English,"Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at J.S. Dorton Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Raleigh, North Carolina.

History, as the saying goes, doesn’t repeat itself, but it does often rhyme. Four years after refusing to concede to Joe Biden with unproven claims of electoral fraud that culminated in the January 6 assault on the Capitol, former president Donald Trump is once again casting doubt on the US presidential election.

Now in a close race against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump and his allies have prepared for years to challenge the outcome if he loses, with strategies aimed at questioning election integrity on multiple fronts.

From the outset of his campaign, Trump has focused heavily on casting doubt on the election process. During the June presidential debate, he was asked three times if he would accept the results of the 2024 election. His answer: he would only do so if the election was “fair and legal and good”.

At his campaign rallies, Trump has urged supporters to anticipate a victory while implying that any loss would be due to corruption.

“I’d love to win the popular vote with them cheating. Let them cheat, because that’s what they do; they do it very well, they’re very professional. But I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote,” he told supporters at a rally in Salem, Virginia, on Saturday.

On social media, he has amplified claims of fraud, especially in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where he recently posted allegations about “fake ballots” and other claims of supposed irregularities.

“We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania. Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, “Who would have ever thought our country could be so CORRUPT?”

This rhetoric sparked rapid responses from officials. Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro responded on X, saying, “In 2020, Donald Trump attacked our elections over and over. He’s now trying to use the same playbook to stoke chaos, but hear me on this: we will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election – and the will of the people will be respected.”

Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Al Schmidt, a Republican, echoed this, telling CNN that any allegations of fraud were ""completely and totally unfounded"". “Voters should have confidence we will have a fair election in 2024, just like we had in 2020,” Schmidt said.

Lawsuits galore

After Trump’s loss in 2020, his team initiated 60 court cases across multiple states to challenge the results, alleging widespread fraud, though none succeeded. This experience led Trump’s team to refine their approach for 2024. According to Olivier Richomme, an electoral law expert and professor of American history at Lyon 2 University, the strategy this time is broader and more calculated.

“Trump has an army of lawyers, co-ordinated by his political adviser Stephen Miller,” Richomme explained. “They’ve already initiated lawsuits well ahead of the election and intend to continue afterward.”

The Republican National Committee (RNC) filed more than 120 lawsuits in 26 states from 2020 through August this year, contesting various election rules. An RNC spokesperson claimed the party’s primary goal was to address issues in voting systems to prevent illegal ballots before Election Day.

“Our Election Integrity operation is focused on securing transparency and fairness for every legal vote,” RNC spokesperson Claire Zunk told Reuters last month. “This ensures voters feel confident that their ballots are counted properly, which ultimately inspires voter turnout.”

Launched in April, the Election Integrity Network is the largest initiative of its kind in US history, enlisting thousands of lawyers and volunteers to address perceived election interference. A number of high-profile conservative donors contributed over $140 million to some 50 groups working to support this effort, according to the Wall Street Journal, funding a comprehensive network for election monitoring, and extensive litigation.

But investigations have found that voter fraud is actually quite rare. A comprehensive audit of elections in the US state of Georgia released last month found that only 20 noncitizens had tried to registered to vote out of 8.2 million registered voters; an additional 156 were flagged for further investigation. Claims that voting machines can be rigged to “flip” votes from one candidate to another have also circulated for years. But “every single” such instance is attributable to human error and not a hacked machine, according to David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, in an interview with CBS News.

Breeding distrust for future elections

Unlike four years ago, Trump no longer holds presidential powers, which limits his influence over US institutions. Without a vice president on his side or a direct line to the attorney general, Trump’s means of challenging the election are reduced.

However, Trump’s years of sowing doubt in the electoral process have done irreparable damage to public confidence. “The real problem is that he has planted the idea in the minds of the American people that there is a problem with electoral fraud,” Richomme said. “We’re seeing a growing part of the electorate suspicious of elections.”

Trump’s allies within the GOP are mirroring his rhetoric, with nearly half of Republican candidates for Congress or state office publicly questioning the upcoming election’s integrity. For instance, Illinois House Representative Brian Babin recently posted on X, claiming that “Democrat counties refuse to clean up voter rolls, are counting aliens in censuses, and are using Harris' open borders to replace US voters to hold a perpetual majority”.

Richomme warns that this rising tide of mistrust could alter American politics well beyond this election.

“There are more and more cases of Republican elected officials who make a habit of questioning election results. They will run for office but refuse to accept election results when they don’t go their way.”

‘A weakening of American democracy’

Democrats are also gearing up for a contested election, including any premature declarations of victory from Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris announced plans for a rapid-response strategy to counter any such claims.

“We are sadly ready if he does and, if we know that he is actually manipulating the press and attempting to manipulate the consensus of the American people … we are prepared to respond,” Harris said during an interview with ABC in late October.

Democrats have also prepared a team of thousands of lawyers to respond to any legal challenges lodged by the Trump campaign.

However, in the event of an actual Trump win, Democrats have signaled they would refrain from questioning the results. As Richomme points out, “It’s not in the Democrats’ tradition, and they campaigned against such actions when Trump was doing it. They’ve made it clear they believe the electoral system functions effectively.”

Regardless of the outcome, this election will likely leave a significant impact on American democratic institutions. Richomme observes that the damage from Trump’s rhetoric may linger long after the votes are counted.

“We are witnessing a weakening of American democracy. This erosion of confidence in the electoral system poses serious threats,” he warned.

Foreign policy is rarely a top priority for US voters. But Israel’s yearlong war in Gaza, as well as its intense bombing campaign in Lebanon, have spurred questions about the US’s role in the conflict.

The administration of President Joe Biden has been unwavering in its support of Israel, splintering the Democratic base, with some voters — particularly Arab Americans — turning against the party.

With Harris in a tight race against former Republican President Donald Trump, anger towards the Biden administration could mean that Arab voters in key states like Michigan stay home in November.

“This is a constituency that, by the second term of the Obama administration, identified as Democrat by a two-to-one margin,” Jim Zogby, the co-founder of the Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Now party identification is virtually tied at 38 percent each.”

Much of that decrease, he said, has to do with the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza, which has erased entire neighbourhoods and killed more than 42,000 people, many of them women and children.

That campaign has been enabled by about $20bn in US weapons assistance.

“It’s less that this group of voters is getting more conservative, and more that they want to punish this administration for what they’ve allowed to happen,” said Zogby.

“There’s a sense that Palestinian and Lebanese lives don’t matter.”

Eroding support

A September poll by the Arab American Institute found that Harris and Trump were virtually tied among Arab voters, receiving 41 percent and 42 percent support, respectively.

That figure is actually a marked improvement for the Democrats. When Biden was running for re-election, his support among Arab voters cratered after the beginning of the war in Gaza, dropping to just 17 percent in October 2023.

Biden previously won 59 percent of the Arab vote in the 2020 presidential race.

When Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, following a debate performance that underscored concerns about the 81-year-old’s age, some voters hoped his replacement, Harris, would bring a fresh approach.

But Harris has thus far refused to break with Biden or call for an end to weapons transfers, even as a series of escalatory strikes by Israel have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider regional war.

In a TV interview this week, when asked whether she would have diverged from Biden on any issues, Harris replied: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”

The Harris campaign also fielded criticism during August’s Democratic National Convention, after party officials refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage to give voice to the suffering in Gaza.

“People are looking for the slightest gesture of humanity, and the campaign just won’t give it to them,” said Zogby. “They’re making a mistake that will cost them votes.”

Swing states

While US policy towards Gaza may not be a top priority for most voters, more than 80 percent of Arab Americans say that it will play an important role in determining their vote.

Many of those voters are concentrated in a small number of swing states that play an outsized role in deciding the country’s presidential elections.

The Midwestern battleground state of Michigan, for instance, has the second-largest Arab population in the country. It also has the largest percentage of Arab Americans of any state: Nearly 392,733 people identify as Arab in a state of 10 million.

Polling averages show Harris with a lead of only around 1.8 percent there, well within the margin of error.

And her razor-thin lead in the state could be eroded by third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who has actively courted the Arab and Muslim American vote in the area.

“The situation in Gaza has complicated Democratic chances in Michigan,” said Michael Traugott, a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.

“Since we expect things to be close, it will hurt Harris if a large portion of the state’s Arab community stays home on election day,” he added.

But Michigan’s Arab American population is no monolith, and there have been bitter divisions within the community over how best to use its electoral leverage.

Some believe that a Harris loss in Michigan would send a warning to future candidates about underestimating the influence of Arab voters.

Others view a second term for Trump, a pro-Israel hawk, as an unacceptable risk: the Republican has previously said that Israel should “finish the job” in Gaza and vowed to deport foreign nationals involved in pro-Palestine student protests.

One group attempting to walk a tightrope between those perspectives is the Uncommitted National Movement, an organisation born of a protest movement against Biden.

During primaries, the movement called on Democrats to vote “uncommitted”, rather than throwing their support behind the Democratic president.

Now, as the general election approaches on November 5, the movement says it cannot support Harris — but it also opposes a second Trump presidency.

“As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising,” a spokesperson said in a video released this week.

“But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”

Expanding fighting

The final weeks of the presidential race have coincided with the looming threat of further escalation in the Middle East, adding an element of uncertainty to the final weeks of the US race.

In early October, for instance, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel, in response to the assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, among others.

On that same day, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon, in addition to its deadly aerial bombing campaign in the region. Israel is expected to take further action against Iran as well.

Analysts worry that a massive Israeli retaliation could set off a destructive war between Israel and Iran, an anxiety shared by many in the US.

A September poll by the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the fighting spreading to other countries in the Middle East. Forty percent felt the same about the possibility of US forces becoming more directly involved.

Respondents who identified with the Democratic Party were also more likely to believe that Israel’s war in Gaza has gone too far and that the US should do more to bring it to an end.

Laura Silver, associate director of global research at Pew, told Al Jazeera that those results reflect diverging views between Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy.

“Republican-affiliated Americans are much more likely to want the US to provide weapons to Israel, and they’re somewhat less likely to want the US to play a diplomatic role,” Silver said.

She pointed out that younger and older people also had different approaches to the war in Gaza — and the Israel-Palestine conflict more generally.

A February poll found that 36 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 said the Biden administration favoured Israel too much in the current war, compared with just 16 percent of people aged 50 to 64.

But Zogby said that Democrats have yet to recognise the shifts taking place among important constituencies, such as young people and communities of colour, on the question of Palestine.

“The pro-Palestine movement has become part of a larger focus on social justice,” he said. “The Democratic Party hasn’t changed on this, but the people who vote for them have. They aren’t listening, and they’ll pay a price for that.”",Will escalating violence in the Middle East affect the US elections?

"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,How does voting work in the US election? - Al Jazeera English,"As Trump and Harris ride neck-and-neck towards Tuesday’s election, here is a guide to how the balloting works.

As Election Day in the United States looms, many Americans have already cast their votes in early voting in person or by mail. Others will vote in person at registered polling booths on Tuesday.

Here is how voting in the US works:

Who conducts elections in the US?

The US does not have a centralised election system.

While the Federal Election Commission enforces federal campaign finance laws, including monitoring donations and public funding for presidential campaigns, the elections themselves are conducted by local authorities within each state.

These authorities adhere to local, state and federal laws as well as being guided by the US Constitution. Hence, election rules vary among states. According to Ballotpedia in 2020, more than 10,000 local entities administered elections in the US.

What time do polls open and close?

Timing depends on the state and municipality. Some polls in Vermont, for example, open as early as 5am Eastern time (ET) (10:00 GMT) in a country with six time zones.

In many states, polls open between 7am and 8am ET (12:00 to 13:00 GMT), including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Florida.

In Hawaii, polls don’t open until noon ET (17:00 GMT), which is 7am local time.

Polling stations close between 7pm ET and 1am ET (00:00 to 06:00 GMT).

How do voters cast their votes?

In the US, no one is required by law to cast a vote. The US does not have a system of online voting.

Voters are assigned polling locations within each district. These locations are generally public buildings, such as convention centres, libraries, schools and community centres.

In these locations, voters enter private polling booths to fill out their ballots.

You can find your polling station by entering your details in your state’s poll locator portal using this link by nonpartisan, nonprofit organisation Vote.org.

Hand-marked ballots

Most voters in the US vote with hand-marked paper ballots. Typically, voters fill in an oval or square next to their preferred candidate’s name.

According to the Philadelphia-based nonpartisan organisation Verified Voting, nearly 70 percent of registered voters live in jurisdictions that use hand-marked paper ballots.

Ballot-marking devices

Some jurisdictions provide ballot marking devices (BMDs) that allow voters to cast their votes on a digital device. The device then produces a paper record of the vote. About 25 percent of registered voters live in jurisdictions that use BMDs for all voters.

Direct recording electronic voting

A small number of voters cast their votes using a direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system, with which voters press a button or touchscreen to cast their votes, which then go directly into the computer system. In 2020, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas used DRE machines, according to the Council of State Governments website.

Some DRE systems are connected to a Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail printer, which produces a paper record of each vote that the voters can confirm before their vote is recorded in the computer.

Five percent of registered voters live in jurisdictions that use DREs for all voters.

How many people have already voted in the US?

All US states allow voters to cast their ballots before Election Day. Mail-in ballots are the most common method of early voting. All except three states also allow in-person voting before Election Day.

In Alabama, early voting started on September 11 as the state distributed mail-in ballots.

As of Sunday, 77,317,453 people in the US had already cast their votes, according to a tracker on AP News. It is estimated that more than 230 million people are eligible to vote in the US. But only about 160 million of them are registered voters, and not all of them will actually vote.

What ID is required to cast a vote in the US?

It depends on the state.

Thirty-five states require voters to show some form of valid ID. For 25 of these states, this has to be a photo ID. Commonly accepted forms of ID include a driver’s licence or passport.

Fifteen states do not require voters to show any ID at polling stations. For example, Nevada does not require voters to bring ID. Instead, voters are asked to sign their name at the polling station, and the signature is compared with the signature and ID they provided when they registered to vote.

Some states that do not require an ID still require voters to show their ID if it is their first time voting or if they did not provide valid ID at the time of registration.

How does the vote count work?

In the US, there is no federal system of counting votes, and the vote count is left up to the states.

Hand-marked paper ballots and ballots marked by BMDs are typically counted using optical scanners and then tabulated digitally to obtain a final tally. Different states have different methods of re-counting and verifying the final count.

States have until December 11 to certify their election results.

What happens next?

The president is not elected directly by the popular vote but instead by the Electoral College.

Under this system, each state has the same number of electors in the Electoral College as its number of seats in the US House of Representatives and Senate. The US has a total of 538 electors, who are appointed by the parties and are almost always party officials or supporters. To win, a candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes.

These electors will meet on December 17 this year to cast the vote for president and vice president.

All states except two operate a winner-takes-all system in choosing their electors, meaning all their Electoral College votes go to whichever candidate wins the most votes.

The only exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, whose Electoral College votes could be split between parties. Their distribution is based on the popular vote within the state and at congressional district levels.

There have been cases in previous elections in which electors have gone against the state’s vote, casting their vote for another candidate. They are called “faithless electors”.

In the highly unlikely but not impossible event of a tie – 269 electoral votes each – the US House of Representatives would decide the next president in what is known as a “contingent election”. Each state’s delegation in the lower chamber of Congress would cast one vote. A candidate must receive a majority of those votes to win.

The US Senate would then choose the vice president with each senator casting one vote and a simple majority (51 votes) required to win.

This means it is theoretically possible that Trump could be voted in as president alongside Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz or Harris could be voted in alongside Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.",How does voting work in the US election?

"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,"US election: 12 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to - Al Jazeera English","With less than two weeks until voting day, Trump and Harris are sharpening their attacks and pitches in key swing states.

With just 12 days until the US election, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed undecided voters at a CNN town hall in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.

Among the seven swing states that analysts believe could determine the outcome of the election, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize, with 19 Electoral College votes.

Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump delivered remarks at a “Georgia for Trump” rally. Georgia, with 16 Electoral College votes, is another key battleground state – Trump won it in 2016 but narrowly lost the state to President Joe Biden in 2020.

According to tracking data from the Election Lab at the University of Florida, nearly 25 million voters have already cast their ballots, either through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots.

What are the latest updates from the polls?

A new poll from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) released on Wednesday revealed that Trump is leading Harris by 2 percentage points nationally, with 47 percent to her 45 percent. This contrasts with Harris’s 2-point lead in the WSJ’s August survey. Both margins are within the polls’ margins of error, suggesting that either candidate could be in the lead. Most polls to date have shown Harris ahead in the national vote, with the two candidates neck-and-neck in swing states.

According to the WSJ the survey also suggests that voters have developed a more favourable perception of Trump’s agenda and past performance, while their view of Harris has become more negative.

In a separate analysis from FiveThirtyEight’s daily election poll tracker, as of Wednesday, Harris is slightly ahead in the average of national polls, leading Trump by 1.8 percentage points. However, the long-term trend shows the race tightening, with the gap continuing to narrow.

While national surveys provide valuable insights into voter sentiment, the Electoral College will determine the ultimate winner, which depends on results from individual states.

The seven key swing states that could determine who wins are Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), North Carolina (16), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10) and Nevada (6). Together, they account for 93 Electoral College votes.

Currently, in these swing seven states, Harris has a razor-thin lead in Nevada and Wisconsin and a slightly larger lead in Michigan, which has increased from a narrow 0.2 percent to 0.7 percent. Trump has a lead of more than 1.5 percent in Arizona and Georgia, with North Carolina and Pennsylvania also showing very narrow margins in his favour.

All these states fall within a statistical margin of error and could sway either way during the election.

What was Kamala Harris up to on Wednesday?

Harris took the stage at the CNN town hall aimed at winning support from undecided voters in Pennsylvania.

“I pledge to be a president for all Americans,” she told an attendee who asked about her plans to bridge the deep political divide in the country.

She also said her administration will not be a continuation of Biden’s, adding that she represents “a new generation of leadership”. However, Harris has repeatedly failed to meaningfully articulate how her policies would differ from Biden’s.

When asked about her weaknesses, she admitted, “I am certainly not perfect,” noting that her decision-making can sometimes be slowed by seeking various perspectives and overanalysing issues.

Harris reaffirmed a key promise of Biden’s agenda, stating that no households earning less than $400,000 will face higher taxes. But she was less certain about whether those with higher incomes would see tax increases.

I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.pic.twitter.com/ubnpC2Z5zP — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 24, 2024

Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff, John Kelly, claimed he had witnessed Trump express admiration for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. “He commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too,’” Kelly told The New York Times.

On Wednesday, in the town hall, Harris characterised Kelly’s comments as a “911 call to the people”, emphasising his rationale for opposing Trump’s return to the White House. When asked if she considers Trump a fascist, Harris responded, “Yes, I do.”

During the town hall, she also said she believed in equality between Israel and Palestinians, saying both groups have the right to their own countries.

“Far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It’s unconscionable,” Harris said. But she said there might be an opportunity to end this war “and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety that they so rightly deserve”.

She also condemned anti-Semitism in the US, emphasising the need for more laws to serve as a “deterrent” against hate crimes.

What was Donald Trump up to on Wednesday?

Trump spoke at rallies in Zebulon and Duluth, Georgia.

In Zebulon, he remarked that “in many ways, it’s sad” that his time as a political candidate is ending. If he wins on November 5, he will begin his second and final term.

Trump kicked off his campaign rally in Georgia by asking the crowd, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”

The crowd responded “no”. “That was very unanimous, wasn’t it,” Trump said. “The answer is no. By any standard, the answer is no.”

In his address, Trump primarily focused on immigration and border security. “We will stop illegal immigration once and for all,” he declared. “It will be ended.” He then added: “I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.”

He urged his supporters to defeat Harris “with a landslide that is too big to rig” and reminded them that early voting is currently taking place. “Get everyone you know,” he said.

Towards the end of his event, Trump expressed his eagerness to collaborate with tech billionaire Elon Musk and mentioned former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbard, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and has now declared herself a Republican.

On Kelly’s comments, Trump avoided attacking him directly.

“Trump has said that Kamala Harris is essentially basing her campaign on lies and statements that can be easily disproved,” Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said, reporting from Duluth, Georgia.

“Trump has certainly been dismissive of Kelly in the past, and I’ve been speaking to other people here in the crowd [at Trump’s Georgia rally], and they said simply either Trump should not be taken literally, or that John Kelly is making up stories because he was fired by Trump,” Fisher added.

“Just to point out, John Kelly was a decorated four-star general who Trump initially had as homeland security secretary and then promoted to chief of staff in the White House before the two fell out, and he was fired.”

What’s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?

Harris campaigns with Barack Obama in Georgia

Rock legend Bruce Springsteen will join former President Barack Obama at rallies with Harris in the critical battleground states of Georgia and Pennsylvania on Thursday and Monday.

This marks the beginning of a series of concerts to increase early voting turnout in competitive areas. So far, more than 1.6 million Georgians have already cast their ballots.

“Georgia is an important stop for both candidates in this election; it has 16 Electoral College votes. It’s quite a significant number, and in the past, it has been solidly Republican, but it flipped in 2020 to Joe Biden,” Al Jazeera’s Fisher said.

“That is why Donald Trump is spending time here and why, on Thursday, Harris will be campaigning with Obama, trying to convince voters that she’s the one who should be in the White House in January,” he added.

Trump will be in Arizona and Nevada

Trump will head west on Thursday.

He will appear at rallies in Arizona and Nevada. Then, on Friday, he is expected to travel to Texas to make remarks focused on border security and migrant crime, his campaign says.

The announcement comes after news that Harris will be in Texas on the same day to reemphasise her campaign’s focus on reproductive care, an issue Democrats consider crucial this year.

On Friday, the former president will be in Traverse City, Michigan – another swing state – to rally supporters.","US election: 12 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/24/us-election-12-days-left-who-is-ahead-what-harris-and-trump-are-up-to

With eight days to go to the election, former President Donald Trump hosted a rally at Madison Square Garden in his hometown of New York while Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.

At the Madison Square Garden Rally on Sunday, Trump repeatedly rammed home his plans to halt undocumented immigration and deport migrants he described as “vicious and bloodthirsty criminals”.

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris said in Philadelphia that nobody should sit on the sidelines. “We are focused on the future and the needs of the American people,” she said.

By midday on Sunday (16:00 GMT), more than 41 million Americans had already voted in early in-person voting or via mail-in ballots, according to a tally by the Election Lab at the University of Florida. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic – more than 100 million voters had cast their ballots before Election Day.

Harris and Trump remain neck-and-neck in this very tight race.

A CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday showed that Harris is leading Trump nationally, with 50 percent compared to Trump’s 49 percent, but the result remains subject to the survey’s margin of error.

The poll also showed that there is a major gender divide in the race, with more men preferring Trump and more women preferring Harris. Trump, the poll shows, leads male voters by 54 percent to 45 percent, while Harris leads women voters by 55 percent to 43 percent.

Men are more likely to view Trump as a strong leader (64 percent to 50 percent), while women are more likely to say Harris has the right “mental and cognitive health” to be president, according to the poll.

In a separate analysis from FiveThirtyEight’s daily election poll tracker, Harris was slightly ahead in the national polls as of Sunday, leading Trump by 1.4 percentage points. However, the long-term trend shows that the race is getting closer, with the gap narrowing from 1.7 points last week.

Seven US swing states are likely to determine the outcome of the election.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s daily poll tracker, Harris retains a narrow lead in Michigan and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump holds a slight edge over Harris in Pennsylvania and Nevada and enjoys a more substantial lead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia.

In all seven states, however, the candidates are within two points of each other, well within the polls’ margins of error, leaving each state a tossup just days before the final vote.

What was Kamala Harris up to on Sunday?

On Sunday, the Democratic candidate spoke at Philadelphia’s Church of Christian Compassion, where she stressed the stakes of the election, describing it as the “most consequential election of our lifetime”.

“In just nine days, we have the power to decide the fate of our nation for generations to come,” said Harris, in comments carried by CBS Philadelphia.

“Here, in Pennsylvania, right now each of us has an opportunity to make a difference,” she said. “The great thing about living in a democracy is we, the people, have the choice to answer that question. So let us answer not just with our words, but with our works.”

Harris also addressed young voters, calling them “rightly impatient for change”.

To Gen Z: You who have only known the climate crisis are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet.

You who grew up with active shooter drills know what we have to do for safety in our schools.

You who may have fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers are… — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 27, 2024

On Sunday, Harris was asked by reporters whether she was concerned about the recent conversations between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two shared a close relationship during Trump’s presidency.

Asked if these talks could undermine the current US government’s objectives, she responded, “No.”

“I do believe that it is critically important that we as the United States of America be an active participant in encouraging one, that this war ends, that we get the hostages out but also that there is a real commitment among nations to a two-state solution and the ‘day after’ [in Gaza],” Harris told reporters.

A recent Arab News/YouGov poll found that Arab-American support for Trump (45 percent) slightly surpassed that for Harris (43 percent), with more respondents also seeing Trump as more likely to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict.

What was Donald Trump up to on Sunday?

The Republican candidate rallied his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base at an event in New York City, promising to crack down on migration and taking aim at Harris.

“November 5 will be the most important date in the history of our country and, together, we will make America powerful again,” said the former president, who painted a portrait of a country plagued by economic and social crises.

Trump also blamed Harris – whom he described as a “radical left Marxist” who is unintelligent and “unfit” to serve as president – for the problems the country faces. “You’ve destroyed our country,” he said, referring to the US vice president.

Separately, a comedian’s controversial performance ignited backlash after he referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage”.

Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe asked, “where are my proud Latinos at tonight?”, before diving into a string of jokes about immigration and the Texas-Mexico border. “You guys see what I mean? It’s wide open; there’s so many of them,” he added.

Hinchcliffe’s performance took a drastic turn when he likened Puerto Rico, a US territory, to ocean waste.

“There’s a lot going on, like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Hinchcliffe said.

His joke was immediately criticised by Harris’s campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states. Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe’s comments.

The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.

What’s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?

Kamala Harris and Tim Walz – joint rally in Michigan

Harris and vice presidential nominee Tim Walz are hosting a campaign rally and concert in Ann Arbor, a college town in Michigan. The event will feature a performance by singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers.

In Michigan, Harris and Trump are battling to woo voters, including an Arab American and Muslim population deeply concerned about Israel’s war on Gaza.

Trump fully backs Israel but has not said how he would end the conflict. Even so, he appears to be gaining support from some Muslim Americans who are unhappy with President Joe Biden and Harris’s support of Israel throughout the war so far.

“It’s safe to say it’s a must-win state for Kamala Harris, and yet Arab Americans – who have been supporting Democrats much more than supporting Republicans since 2004 and Iraq and Abu Ghraib – have really been disaffected by the Biden administration and by Kamala Harris’s lack of distancing herself from the Biden administration on the issue of Gaza [and] now Lebanon,” John Zogby, a pollster and founder of John Zogby Strategies, told Al Jazeera.

Trump rally in Georgia

Trump will address Atlanta on Monday.

He will begin with a speech at the National Faith Summit in Powder Springs and conclude with a rally at Georgia Tech.

According to local media reports, Trump will first address more than 1,000 pastors and faith leaders before heading to McCamish Pavilion for his scheduled campaign rally.

Trump is expected to emphasise economic issues and promote early voting.

Georgia, with 16 Electoral College votes, is another key battleground state – Trump won it in 2016 but narrowly lost the state to President Biden in 2020.","US election: 8 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/28/us-election-8-days-left-what-polls-say-what-harris-and-trump-are-up-to

"Thu, 31 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,Show us the money: How big money dominates the 2024 US election - Al Jazeera English,"Each election cycle, billions of dollars flow into US political campaigns. But where does all this cash come from?

The 2024 US presidential election is on track to be the costliest election in modern history.

When Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race in June and backed Vice President Kamala Harris to face former President Donald Trump, it triggered a huge flow of cash to the Democrats. In the 24 hours after Harris announced her candidacy, $81m flooded her campaign fund.

Harris’s campaign has been a major cash cow for the Democratic Party. She set a new record, pulling in $1bn in three months. She entered October with a huge cash advantage over Trump, having outraised the Republican Party candidate almost three-to-one, in September, pulling in $378m. Harris has also edged Trump in the battle for small donors.

Despite a smaller war chest, Trump still has deep pockets, raising $160m in September. At a June event, Trump walked away with $50m after addressing donors for roughly 45 minutes. And thanks to his loyal base, when he was found guilty of falsifying business records in May, Trump used his conviction to raise $52.8m in about 24 hours, according to his campaign. Trump also leveraged an assassination attempt and his New York mugshot to extract millions from donors.

What are the rules of funding?

In the US, campaign finance is regulated by a series of laws, which aim to prevent corruption while promoting transparency. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces these rules.

Individuals, organisations, and companies can contribute to political campaigns, but there are limits on how much they can give directly to candidates.

Individuals usually contribute the lion’s share of any given candidate’s campaign funds. Wealthier donors tend to give more. Legally, individuals can donate up to $3,300 per candidate, per election in the 2024 cycle.

Both parties have federal- and state-level committees that also raise money. Candidates can also self-fund, as Trump has partially done in the past.

What’s a super PAC?

There are ways to get around the contribution limits – political action committees (PACs) and super PACs, which play a monumental role in US elections. PACs pool contributions from members and donate them to campaigns, with limits of $5,000 per candidate per year. PACs often represent industries like oil or aerospace, or focus on issues like climate change or gun rights.

Super PACs, created after a 2010 Supreme Court ruling, are funded by individuals, unions, and corporations. Unlike PACs, they can donate unlimited amounts to independent organisations linked to a candidate, but cannot give to, or coordinate directly with, campaigns.

And that freedom allows the wealthy to pump as much money as they want to support their preferred candidate. So far, outside spending from these groups has totalled approximately $2.8bn since 2010, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group tracking money in politics. Much of that money funds advertising, mailings, canvassing, and online presence.

What’s the impact?

The influence of money in politics raises concerns. Super PACs especially open the door for significant contributions, often raising questions about whether elections truly reflect the will of the people or that of elite donors.

Elon Musk, the controversial tech billionaire — and the world’s richest person — who endorsed Trump, announced in July that he planned to donate about $45m monthly to the America PAC, a Trump-supporting super PAC that he set up. His fundraising efforts, focussed on voter registration and early voting in battleground states, have faced scrutiny. Meanwhile, Miriam Adelson, the conservative billionaire, donated $95m to another super PAC supporting Trump, CNN has reported.

The rise of “dark money” — contributions not required to disclose donors — has also made transparency harder to achieve. OpenSecrets reported an “unprecedented surge” in dark money during the 2023 and 2024 cycles, which could surpass the $660m from unknown sources in 2020.

In some cases, PACs and Super PACs are even a way of influencing another party from the one the donor supports. For example, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which specifically aims to fund candidates who back Israel and support the opponents of those who don’t, was found to be the biggest source of money from Republican-aligned donors to Democrats in the latter’s primaries earlier this year, according to an analysis by Politico.

That money successfully helped to defeat Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, two pro-Palestinian progressives in the House of Representatives, during their primaries this year.

What’s being done?

Campaign finance reform could help balance the scales, but efforts advocating for stricter donation limits, transparency, and public financing have not gained traction at the federal level.

In 2022, President Biden called dark money a “serious” threat to democracy and urged Congress to pass a campaign finance bill requiring political groups to disclose big donors. Senate Republicans blocked the bill. There are state initiatives, however, helping balance the scales. New York City has a public matching system, where small-dollar donations are matched by public funds, amplifying the voices of more modest contributors over large donors.

Other efforts, like the Honest Ads Act, had aimed to make political advertising more transparent, by providing more information on the people buying the advertisements. It was folded into the Freedom to Vote Act, but that has failed to pass the US Senate.",Show us the money: How big money dominates the 2024 US election  Al Jazeera English,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/31/show-us-the-money-how-big-money-dominates-the-2024-us-election

Watch: Where do things stand on election morning in the US?

Never in recent US political history has the outcome of a presidential election been so in doubt - this is not a contest for the faint of heart. While past elections have been narrowly decided - George W Bush's 2000 victory over Al Gore came down to a few hundred votes in Florida - there's always been some sense of which direction the race was tilting in the final days. Sometimes, as in 2016, the sense is wrong. In that year, polls overestimated Hillary Clinton's strength and failed to detect a late-breaking movement in Donald's Trump favour. This time around, however, the arrows are all pointing in different directions. No-one can seriously make a prediction either way. Follow live election day updates

What do final polls tell us about who is winning?

When will we know who has won?

A coin-toss

Most of the final polls are well within the margin of error, both nationally and in the seven key battleground states that will decide the election. Based on statistics and sample sizes alone, that means either candidate could be ahead. It is this uncertainty that vexes political pundits and campaign strategists alike. There have been a smattering of surprises - not least one notable example, a recent respected survey of Republican-leaning Iowa giving Harris a shock lead. But the major polling averages, and the forecasting models that interpret them, all show this as a coin-toss contest.

A clear winner is still possible

Just because the outcome of this election is uncertain, that doesn't mean the actual result won't be decisive - a shift of a few percentage points either way, and a candidate could sweep all of the battleground states. If the voter turnout models are wrong and more women head to the polls, or more rural residents, or more disaffected young voters - that could dramatically shift the final results. There could also be surprises among key demographic groups. Will Trump really make the inroads with young black and Latino men that his campaign has predicted? Is Harris winning over a larger proportion of traditionally Republican suburban women, as her team is hoping? Are elderly voters - who reliably vote every election and tend to lean to the right - moving into the Democratic column? Americans anxious as two nations collide Once this election is in the rear-view mirror, we may be able to conclusively point to a reason why the winning candidate came out on top. Perhaps, in hindsight, the answer will be obvious. But anyone who says they know how things will turn out right now is fooling you - and themselves.

How the US presidential campaign unfolded in 180 seconds

Blue Walls and Red Walls

In most US states the outcome of the presidential vote is all but certain. But there are seven key battleground states that will decide this election. Not all battleground states are created equal, however. Each candidate has a ""wall"" of three states that offers the most direct path to the White House. Harris's so-called ""blue"" wall, named for the colour of the Democratic Party, stretches across Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the Great Lakes region. It has been the subject of much political conversation since 2016, when Trump narrowly won all three traditionally Democratic states on his way to victory. Joe Biden flipped these states back in 2020. If Harris can hold them, she doesn't need any other battleground, as long as she also wins a congressional district in Nebraska (which has a slightly different system in how it awards its electoral college votes). That explains why she has spent the bulk of her time in these blue wall states during the campaign's final stretch, with full days on the ground in each. Visual guide - Harris and Trump's paths to victory

The moment I decided who to vote for On Monday night, she held her final rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the top of the 72 steps leading to the city's Museum of Art, which Sylvester Stallone's fictional boxer Rocky climbed in the film of the same name - before narrowly losing to his opponent, Apollo Creed. Trump's ""red wall"" sits along the eastern edge of the US. It is less talked about but equally important to his electoral chances. It starts in Pennsylvania but stretches south to North Carolina and Georgia. If he carries these states, he will win by two electoral votes, no matter how the other battlegrounds vote. That explains why he's held five events in North Carolina just in the last week. The overlapping point on each of these walls, of course, is Pennsylvania - the biggest battleground electoral prize. Its nickname, the Keystone State, has never been more appropriate.

"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,White-wing politics dominating US election spell trouble for the world - Al Jazeera English,"With less than a fortnight to go till presidential elections are held in the United States, leading candidates are making their final appeals to the electorate. However, it is not clear among many America watchers whether what has been described as one of the most consequential elections in a generation actually lives up to the billing.

The importance of the election itself is undeniable, given it is taking place in the wealthiest, most populous and most powerful nation in the Caucasian bloc.

More than 160 million people across the vast state have registered to vote, and regimes across North America and sub-Scandinavian Europe are paying close attention since the outcome will doubtlessly influence opinion on the Caucasian street.

However, for much of the rest of the world, it is unclear whether the two leading candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris from the ruling Democratic Party, and the country’s former strongman, Donald Trump, from the far-white Christianist opposition, represent differing visions of the country’s place in the world.

Both campaigns have espoused extremist white-wing views regarding continued support for the violence in Gaza and Lebanon, where the US proxy, Israel, has been conducting a campaign of destruction, extermination and ethnic cleansing. Although Harris has called for the “war” to end, and current President Joe Biden, who has named her as his preferred successor, has threatened to cut off arms supplies to Israel if it continues to use starvation as a weapon of war, her aides clarified that this was just political theatre. Harris herself has said she would continue supplying arms to the apartheid state which has illegally occupied and stolen Palestinian land since 1967, despite Israel’s former National Security Council deputy director, Eran Etzion, acknowledging that the country was engaged in war crimes and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Trump’s Republican Party is widely considered the political wing of apocalyptic Christianist extremist militants who believe that the establishment of Israel heralds the end of the world in a final battle between good and evil that will see the Messiah return to take them to heaven to play harps. It is thus not surprising that they have opposed any restrictions on the supply of weapons.

Further, both Trump and Harris have refused to accept the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the illegality of the occupation, and oppose the application of international humanitarian law and International human rights law to the situation. Nor do they even accept the findings of numerous global human rights organisations as well as the United Nations itself, which say Israel is practising apartheid against the Palestinians.

This is in line with a deeply reclusive and xenophobic tradition within the oil-rich, former British colony which was founded on the genocide of the Indigenous Native American population and grew prosperous on the enslavement of thousands of Africans. Both candidates have vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. Although the country is commonly defined, most famously by its slain former President John F Kennedy, as “a nation of immigrants”, it still frowns on more recent migrant workers from neighbouring countries. These migrants, many of them lacking the necessary permits to live and work in the nuclear-armed country, face difficulties and exploitation, especially at the hands of people without colour who still make up the majority in the overwhelmingly white-wing, xenophobic nation.

In addition, both campaigns would maintain US refusal to accede to international agreements such as the Rome Treaty, which establishes the International Criminal Court, the Landmine Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Despite a global consensus on the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels to combat climate change, the candidates have been trying to outdo each other in support of fracking, a particularly dirty way of extracting oil from rocks. Under previous regimes, including under Biden and Trump, the US, one the world’s top banana-exporting republics, has also flip-flopped over joining international agreements to limit carbon emissions.

All of this is ironic given both campaigns’ penchant to style the country as a global leader, which plays well with domestic audiences with limited access to external news sources and where most adults have limited knowledge about geography and world affairs.

Whatever the outcome, analysts have reason to worry about the impact the election will have on the Caucasian bloc and especially on the European pseudo-continent. It could further the embrace of extreme white-wing politics and policies, encourage more environmental disregard and degradation, and exacerbate regional tribal conflicts that have twice in the 20th century ballooned into all-out war, forcing the rest of the world to intervene.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative - Brookings Institution,"There are many reasons for the stunning election victories of Donald Trump and congressional Republicans: inflation fears, concerns about border security, worries about cultural issues related to race, gender, and sexuality, and feelings that President Joe Biden and the country as a whole were headed in the wrong direction. As my colleague Bill Galston persuasively has argued, people’s judgements about inflation and immigration were harsh during this election season, and these views harmed their assessments of Kamala Harris and strengthened the case for Trump.

But we can’t ignore the ways in which disinformation shaped views about the candidates, affected how voters saw leader performance, and generated widespread media attention. As Elaine Kamarck and I argue in our Brookings Press book “Lies That Kill: A Citizen’s Guide to Disinformation,” there are systematic and organized efforts to shape public opinion in many areas, from public health and climate change to race relations.

So, we shouldn’t be surprised that the same thing happened during the 2024 election. Campaign examples this fall include the infamous stories about immigrants eating cats and dogs, hurricane disaster relief funding going to undocumented immigrants, Kamala Harris in a swimsuit hugging convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the supposed case of Tim Walz abusing a young man 30 years ago. Disinformation flowed into our info-ecosystem from other countries as well. One video featured a Haitian man (although he was not really Haitian) saying he had just gotten to the United States and had voted in two counties—Gwinnett and Fulton—in Georgia, but it turned out to be a fake video made in Russia.

These and other efforts were successful in shaping the campaign narrative because they were disseminated broadly on social media platforms, promoted through funny memes, picked up and publicized by mainstream media outlets, circulated by internet mega-influencers, and amplified by leading candidates during rallies, debates, and interviews. In a situation where public confidence in news reporters is very low and new generative AI tools make it easy to create and disseminate fake pictures, videos, and narratives, the 2024 campaign was rife with organized efforts to sway voters, twist perceptions, and make people believe negative material about various candidates.

Polling data suggest that false claims affected how people saw the candidates, their views about leading issues such as the economy, immigration, and crime, and the way the news media covered the campaign. Take the case of immigration and border security. According to candidate Trump, there were hordes of migrants overrunning the country’s southern border, unfairly monopolizing scarce public resources and endangering public security through dangerous crime waves.

Actual border statistics consistently showed weak support for those claims, but that wasn’t enough to quell unfavorable views about Harris on border security. The idea that 10 million migrants had crossed the border and that many were released after capture was not true, according to independent fact-checkers. Apprehension and release numbers dropped during the Biden administration and were comparable to figures during the Trump administration.

In addition, crime statistics showed that native-born Americans actually committed crimes at levels three times higher than immigrants. According to the National Institute for Justice, native-born Americans committed around 1,100 crimes per 100,000 people, compared to 800 by legal immigrants and 400 for undocumented immigrants. But Trump’s false claims in this area made Harris look ineffective on crime and immigration.

On views about inflation and the overall economy, people in 2024 consistently reported very negative opinions compared to actual inflation, unemployment, and GDP figures. Europeans have been especially perplexed by American’s sour views of the economy. On the eve of the general election, the Economist magazine even had a cover story saying the U.S. economy was the envy of the world. Yet voters had a dismal view of the economy and rated Harris negatively for the economic situation.

For coming political battles, people need to be aware of how the current information ecosystem regularly is promoting falsehoods and skewing views about important issues. But we do not need to stand back and accept widespread misperceptions as the new reality. There are several things people and organizations can do to protect themselves for what will be a continuing wave of misinformation, disinformation, and false narratives.

There needs to be meaningful content moderation by social media platforms. Right now, many leading platforms are cesspools of rumors, false information, and outright lies. They are widely disseminated and seen by millions of people. If that continues, it will become increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction—endangering our country’s ability to address major problems. Companies need to get far more serious about content moderation.

The disinformation risks have grown stronger in recent months due to new tech tools such as generative AI. There are easy-to-use tools that can create false pictures, videos, audio, and narratives. People no longer need a technical background to use AI tools but can make requests through prompts and templates and become master propagandists. We need digital literacy programs that train people on how to evaluate online information and spot fakes and deceptions.

We have to understand how changes in the contemporary political environment make people want to believe negative information about the opposition. In a highly polarized world, where people are divided into competing political tribes, millions of Americans admit they themselves have intentionally spread information they know to be false. If that continues, it will lead to disaster for our country’s politics and governance.

Finally, many individuals and organizations have financial incentives to spread blatant lies. Through websites, newsletters, and digital platforms, they make money from subscriptions, advertising, and merchandise sales. As long as spreading lies is lucrative, it will be hard to get a serious handle on the flood of disinformation that plagues our current system.",How disinformation defined the 2024 election narrative  Brookings Institution,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-disinformation-defined-the-2024-election-narrative/

On Thursday, presidential candidates made a final push to energise voters in the western United States.

At rallies, Vice President Kamala Harris warned supporters that abortion rights are under threat. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump focused his campaign on immigration and border control.

Recent polls from AtlasIntel, released on Thursday, show Trump holding a slight lead of one to two percentage points over his opponent. However, a separate poll from TIPP Insights indicates that the candidates are currently tied.

A recent survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that about 70 percent of Americans feel anxious or frustrated regarding the election, with few expressing enthusiasm.

Both Democrats and Republicans share these sentiments, but Democrats report higher levels of anxiety: 80 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans express interest in the campaign, while only 54 percent of independents feel similarly. Furthermore, 79 percent of Democrats report feeling anxious, compared with 66 percent of Republicans.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s National Polls tracker, Harris maintains a narrow national lead of about 1.2 points as of Thursday. However, this lead has gradually decreased and falls within the margin of error, indicating a highly competitive race.

In critical swing states, which could determine the election outcome, the competition is even tighter.

Key battleground states include Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. FiveThirtyEight’s daily poll tracker indicates that Harris’s lead in Michigan remains slight, at approximately 0.8 points. However, she has lost her lead in Nevada, where Trump now leads by 0.3 points.

In Wisconsin, her lead has dropped to 0.6 points, down from 0.8 points on Wednesday.

On the other hand, Trump’s advantage in Pennsylvania has increased slightly, rising from 0.4 points to 0.7 points. His lead in North Carolina has returned to last week’s levels, now at 1.4 points. Trump is also gaining ground in Arizona, where he leads Harris by 2.4 points, and in Georgia, where his advantage is 1.8 points.

What was Kamala Harris up to on Thursday?

The Harris campaign has zeroed in on what Trump said last night at a campaign rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he told an anecdote about telling his team that he intends “to protect the women of our country”.

“I’m gonna do it whether the women like it or not,” Trump said.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Harris slammed the remarks as “offensive”.

“It actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,” Harris said before embarking on a day of campaigning in the Western battleground states of Arizona and Nevada.

In Phoenix, Mexican American band Los Tigres del Norte kicked off Harris’s rally with a song expressing a desire to eliminate the border and unite the two countries. Founded in the 1960s, the band has a deep resonance on both sides of the border and continues to captivate generations of devoted fans.

In Phoenix, her speech was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters in the first 10 minutes.

Harris paused briefly to acknowledge them. “Hey guys, you know what? Here’s the thing – let’s talk for a moment about Gaza,” she said. “We all want this war to end and get the hostages out, and I will work on it full-time when I am elected president, as I’ve been.”

Harris also contrasted her willingness to engage with those who disagree with her against Trump’s remarks about jailing his opponents. This was mentioned as several protesters were being escorted out, and she said: “Democracy can be complicated sometimes. It’s OK. We’re fighting for the right for people to be heard and not jailed because they speak their mind.″

Since winning the Democratic nomination earlier this year, Harris has at times adopted a confrontational stance towards protesters.

When a group of protesters interrupted her at an August event by chanting, “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide,” Harris responded directly: “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”

On Thursday, during her final stop of the day in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jennifer Lopez also spoke, and there was a performance by the Mexican rock band Mana.

What was Donald Trump up to on Thursday?

At his first rally in New Mexico, Trump urged the crowd to vote for him, promising to solve the border issue. The state, with five Electoral College votes, is widely expected to vote for Harris.

“One of the reasons we will win this state is you have one of the worst border problems of any state, and I’m the only one who will fix it,” he said.

In Henderson, Nevada, Trump accused Harris of operating a lax border policy and promised a mass deportation programme if he is elected.

He began by demonising migrants, saying some are “horrible, deathly” people. He also called Harris “horrible, the worst there is”, while urging his supporters to vote early.

“We’ll fix it fast, and we’re going to have an America that’s bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before,” he added.

In Nevada, many of his supporters wore orange and yellow safety vests.

The fashion choice comes a day after Trump wore a similar ensemble to draw attention to recent comments by President Joe Biden that suggested his supporters were “garbage”.

Al Jazeera’s John Holman, who attended the rally, noted that while Trump concentrated on migration, the primary concern for voters in Nevada is the economy.

“Trump’s rally had a lot of talk about migration, but actually, the key issue here in Nevada for voters – according to polls – is the economy,” Holman said.

“This is the state with the highest unemployment in the US. It’s been hit hard with inflation. Gas prices, in particular, are high, and it’s a state that has never completely recovered from the pandemic,” Holman added.

During his rally, Trump also spoke about inflation, and “he briefly said that he was going to abolish a federal tax on tips,” Holman said.

Trump also spoke at Tucker Carlson’s live tour event in Glendale, Arizona.

What’s next for the Harris and Trump campaigns?

Harris heads to Wisconsin

Harris is heading to Wisconsin, where she is expected to hold an event in the Appleton area at approximately 23:00 GMT, followed by another in Milwaukee at about 02:00 GMT.

The Milwaukee rally and concert features performances by GloRilla, Flo Milli, MC Lyte, The Isley Brothers, DJ GEMINI GILLY.

Cardi B is also anticipated to make an appearance at her rally, joining a growing list of celebrities who have campaigned for her in the final days of the 2024 election.

President Joe Biden will travel to Philadelphia and, on Saturday, to his hometown of Scranton, both in Pennsylvania, where he will aim to energise voters in this key swing state.

Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz is expected to also campaign in the battleground state of Michigan.

Trump heads to Michigan and Wisconsin

Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Dearborn, Michigan – home to the largest Arab-majority population in the nation – on Friday, where he is expected to hold a rally at Macomb Community College in Warren at 20:30 GMT.

As the Arab American vote in Michigan has increased over the years, it has become a critical factor in major elections, such as Bernie Sanders’s primary victory in the state in 2016.

Consequently, Dearborn has drawn significant attention from national and international media during campaign season.

Trump is the first major 2024 candidate to visit the city.

Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who served in the state legislature as a Democrat, has not endorsed any candidates, urging residents to “vote their conscience” instead.

Meanwhile, the Harris campaign is facing outrage after former President Bill Clinton – while campaigning for her – suggested that Zionism predates Islam and that Hamas “forces” Israel to kill Palestinian civilians.","US election: 4 days left – What polls say, what Harris and Trump are up to  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/us-election-4-days-left-what-polls-say-what-harris-and-trump-are-up-to

Donald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Democrats are planning to get illegal immigrants to vote in the US election. “Our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,” Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris. BBC Verify has identified more than 100 paid-for ads on Facebook and Instagram posted by Republicans since the start of September focusing on the issue. It is illegal for a non-US citizen to vote in a national election, but studies suggest cases of this actually happening are very rare.

What laws are in place to stop illegal immigrants voting?

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits non-citizens - which includes illegal immigrants - from voting in federal elections. The punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation. Every state is required to use a common registration form which requires people to confirm they are US citizens, under penalty of perjury for false claims, but does not require documentary proof. “That first step of having to tick a box saying you’re a citizen to register to vote is a huge deterrent for illegal immigrants, as it’s hugely risky to lie,” says Jasleen Singh, a voting expert at the liberal policy think tank Brennan Center for Justice. In many states, voter rolls are cross-referenced with citizenship and immigration services, death certificates, and postal records to make sure that people who are non-citizens, dead, or live out of state are not registered to vote. “At the polls, there’s a list of eligible voters, and if a non-citizen turns up, they’ll be turned away or told to cast a provisional ballot which will only be accepted if they can provide proof of citizenship,” says Prof Ronald Hayduk, a voting rights expert at San Francisco State University. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in state-wide elections either. However, some municipalities in California, Maryland, Vermont and Washington DC do allow them to vote in certain local elections, such as for school boards.

What evidence is there that illegal immigrants vote?

A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of illegal immigrants voting in US federal elections are very rare. One by the Brennan Center for Justice interviewed 44 election officials who worked across 12 states during the 2016 election. It found that out of 23.5 million votes counted in these states, an estimated 30 suspected incidents of non-citizens voting were referred for further investigation. That’s about 0.0001% of all votes cast. An analysis of a database which collected election fraud cases between 1999 and 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, found 77 instances of non-citizens voting. A number of other reports, including by the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, entitled ‘Non-citizens Don’t Illegally Vote in Detectable Numbers’, come to similar conclusions. ""According to many sources of evidence, the number of non-citizens who vote in elections is very small,"" says Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who's written a number of reports on voter fraud. ""It's not zero, some people slip through the cracks for various reasons, but it's nowhere near at the level to impact the outcome of an election.""

What evidence do Republicans cite?

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a Republican proposal which would require people to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, has been rejected in the House of Representatives. Republican lawmakers continue to push for more citizenship requirements. “We have a number of states who have done audits of their voter rolls and found thousands of non-citizens,” the lead Republican in the House, Mike Johnson, told CNN. He highlighted Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia - three states where polls show a tight race between Trump and Kamala Harris. In Ohio, a review called for by Republican officials in the state, found that out of about eight million registered voters, there were 597 cases which have been referred for “further review and potential prosecution” for non-citizens registering to vote. In Pennsylvania, a glitch with electronic touchscreens in state drivers' licence centres wrongly showed non-citizens the option to register to vote while getting new or updated licences. This glitch was in the system between 2006 and 2017, and has since been resolved. In 2017, Pennsylvania state election officials said non-citizen immigrants might have cast 544 ballots illegally out of more than 93 million ballots in elections dating back to 2000. In Georgia, a review of voter rolls in 2022 found 1,634 people “had attempted to register to vote” but “were not able to be verified”, out of about seven million registered voters. “Voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting is so rare that this myth is to sow doubt in election integrity and lay the groundwork to cast doubt on the election outcome,” argues Ms Singh.

Republican ads sow further doubt

BBC Verify has identified 118 paid-for ads posted on Facebook and Instagram since 1 September by Republican candidates or by Republican political groups which claim widespread voter registration of non-citizens, or which raise the question of whether non-citizens should be allowed to vote in elections. The ads we identified were shown between 7.8 and nine million times on the platforms. One - which had more than 2.4 million views - invites users to participate in a poll with the question: ""Should illegal immigrants be allowed to vote?"" Another ad posted by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, with more than 900,000 views, invites users to answer the same question.

Trump’s victory

Donald Trump’s theory of the case was broadly correct. He and his campaign managers believed that it was possible to build on Republicans’ growing strength among white working-class voters to create a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. He was right: If the exit polls turn out to be accurate, he made strides among Latinos and African Americans, especially men. He increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% to 20% and carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%.

The Trump campaign also believed that they could improve their performance among young adults, and they did—from 35% in 2020 to 42% this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of this gain reflected a shift toward Trump among young men. Trump spent lots of time on podcasts, such as Joe Rogan’s, whose principal audiences are this otherwise hard-to-reach group.

After the Republican primaries, the victorious Trump forces faced a choice: They could moderate their message to reach out to disappointed backers of Nikki Haley, who ran a traditional Reagan conservative campaign, or they could continue their all-out appeal to the Republican base while enjoying the grudging support of his defeated adversary. They chose the latter course and won the gamble that the party would unite around them. Donald Trump received 94% of the Republican vote and as a bonus, reduced the Democratic edge among Independents from nine points in 2020 to five points this year.

The Trump campaign’s tactical choices paid off. Three turned out to be critical. First: Convinced that Trump’s intense personal bond with his supporters would do most of the mobilizing work, the campaign decided not to invest heavily in traditional get-out-the-vote organizing and instead outsourced it to supporting organizations. Although the Harris campaign touted its advantage in the “ground game,” there is little evidence that it made much of a difference.

Second: The Trump campaign decided that Harris’ stance on transgender issues was the Willie Horton of 2024 and invested heavily in negative advertising that dominated the airwaves throughout the South.1 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this campaign helped weaken Harris’ effort to portray herself as a common-sense center-left candidate rather than an emissary from San Francisco.

Third: Donald Trump chose to modulate his stance on abortion by declaring early on that each state should decide this matter for itself and then doubling down by vowing to veto a national abortion ban. Many longtime foes of abortion were disappointed, and some were outraged. Nevertheless, Trump paid no price, winning 81% of the white evangelical vote—virtually unchanged from four years ago.

Harris’ defeat

The Harris campaign was always running uphill. She served as vice president to a president whose approval rating plunged in the middle of his first year in office and never recovered. The public’s judgment of his performance on two core issues—inflation and immigration—was harshly negative, and Harris inherited this disapproval when Joe Biden abandoned his quest for a second term.

The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president’s tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters. She did the best she could in the circumstances by quickly unifying the party and building on Biden’s campaign apparatus rather than starting from scratch, but she never entirely overcame the difficulties stemming from Biden’s timetable.

Harris’ theory of the case was flawed. Looking at examples from the 2022 elections, she assumed that putting reproductive rights at the center of her agenda would mobilize an army of angry women and move them to the polls in record numbers. This did not happen. Women’s share of the total vote rose only marginally from its level in 2020, and Harris’ share of the women who voted did not increase from Biden’s 2020 levels. It is hard to judge how much this emphasis on abortion contributed to Harris’ poor showing among men—just 43%, down from Biden’s 48% in 2020—but it did nothing to convince them that a Harris administration would be sensitive to their concerns.

Her closing argument—that Donald Trump posed a clear and present danger to democracy—fared little better. This happened in part because many Republicans and Independents saw Harris and the Democrats as the real threats to democracy, and also because the charge offered no new information that would sway voters whose minds weren’t made up. Donald Trump may be the best-known candidate in modern American history, making it difficult to change anyone’s view of him.

Harris’ tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden’s unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters. Similarly, by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public’s perception of her and opened the door to the Trump campaign’s charge that she was a closet radical. Thinking back to the successful campaign of Bill Clinton in 1992, some Democrats were hoping Harris would have a “Sister Souljah” moment in which she broke with some party orthodoxy in order to show her independence, but this did not happen.

Second, Harris’ decision to avoid media interviews during the first half of her campaign created the impression that she was dependent on scripted remarks and afraid to think on her feet. Answering tough questions can enhance a candidate’s reputation for competence and character, a potential upside to which Harris and her campaign seemed oblivious for much too long.

Conclusion

Democrats knew that the election would be close, but the scope of their defeat will likely trigger recriminations first and then an extended period of soul-searching. As was the case after Michael Dukakis’ defeat in 1988, the party will be forced to engage in a debate about the causes of its defeat, and what is sure to be a long and lively primary campaign will determine the path forward.

Meanwhile, President Trump will be challenged to honor the sweeping promises he made during his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can impose massive tariffs without raising costs for average families and triggering another round of inflation. Also uncertain is whether he can quell conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as he claims while reducing America’s global commitments. And it is possible that trying to deport millions of immigrants present in the U.S. could blow up in his face by creating civil strife and a backlash among Latino voters who have rallied to this cause. If he fails to meet the hopes that he has aroused, especially in the new supporters who provided his majority, he and his party may pay a price in 2026 and beyond.",Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results  Brookings Institution,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/

Rumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election. Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats. The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process. The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.

Many posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign’s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November. When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a ""fair and legal and good election"". A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday. Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state. “Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network. “REPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!” The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud. While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of ""half-truths"" and disinformation circulating on social media. “This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” he said.

Flood of misleading content

The BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each. The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process. One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia. The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by ""Russian influence actors"". Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: “Figured I would drive across the border and vote."" It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border. Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.

Echoes of 2020

Experts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond. It's happened before. In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. ""Stop the steal"" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results. Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead? On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats. While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day. Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists “are preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren’t in 2020”. “We cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,” she said. These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning. “I feel very confident about Trump, as long as there’s no cheating,” said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he’d already heard rumours about fraud. “Our only hope is that it’s not big enough to change the result.” After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.

Isolated fraud incidents blown out of proportion

Experts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters. But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating. In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud. “They WILL cheat,” says one of the thousands of comments posted.

BBC Verify examines claims of US voter fraud

As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards. But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to “rig” the election. “Look at this new cheat voter fraud,” read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. “Dems already doing their best to steal another election.” The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say. “These incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,” said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.

Groups behind the deluge

The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations. Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security. On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities. They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure. “Our hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,” said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters. But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale. “If they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they’re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,” she added. The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment. A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities. Elon Musk’s America political action committee has started a community – akin to a message board – on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock. Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers – partisan observers who attend polling places. The volume of messages on these platforms – along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources – makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation. The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,Donald Trump wins US election – what the experts said - The Conversation,"This was a rolling guide to articles and audio published by The Conversation in the aftermath of the US presidential election.

The United States has made its choice. At just before 8am GMT (3am Florida time) Donald Trump took to the stage at the West Palm Beach convention center and claimed victory for the Republican Party. His declaration came minutes after it was announced he was going to win in the key state of Pennsylvania with its 19 electoral college votes.

He thanked a large crowd of his adoring supporters, saying: “This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond.”

It’s been a turbulent four months since outgoing president Joe Biden announced he was terminating his bid for a second term and the battlelines between the two candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were drawn. Soon we will know who will lead the US for the next four years.

From here, with the help of some of the sharpest analysts of US politics, we’ll keep you updated and informed as the situation develops.

The US has moved to the right

Natasha Lindstaedt says that academics and pundits read the polls (which were broadly right) badly.

The polls were right – he had a lot more strength [than we all thought]. We thought the polls were seriously underestimating Kamala Harris and that she was doing far better than they were predicting, when they said it was a knife edge. But it turns out they were underestimating Trump. The US has moved to the right. The abortion bill wasn’t overturned in Florida, Ted Cruz won by ten points in Texas, a state that we thought might be competitive. We thought with this Iowa poll that Harris might be more competitive with white voters. It’s been a great night for Trump and an absolute disaster for the Democrats.

She said that many people following the campaign thought that women were going to turn out and that would make the difference. But in fact it didn’t.

Trump gained a lot more than he had in 2020 – probably due to nostalgia of what his administration was like, looking at it through rose-coloured glasses, forgetting the chaos and all the upheaval he created himself. Now he’s going to inherit a great economy – and he’s going to take credit for it.

Campaign strategy

Trump pursued a strategy that did not seek to expand support significantly beyond his traditional base, says Todd Landman, professor of political science at the University of Nottingham. Instead he successfully energised and mobilised new voters within his core demographic – especially young male voters, who turned out in huge numbers.

Delivered in Trump’s characteristically strong and idiosyncratic language, his campaign ranged across social and economic issues, such as the cost of living and immigration, as well as pressing foreign policy issues, including the future of Nato, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and international trade – especially with China.

For their part, Democrats will need a serious postmortem, Todd believes.

The party leadership will need to engage in some serious soul-searching on how they failed to appeal to the electorate and how bread and butter issues ultimately propelled Trump back into power. Harris had 107 days to forge a campaign.

Role of the youth vote

Young people in the US have been voting emphatically for Democratic candidates over the past 20 years, says Professor James Sloam of Royal Holloway University of London. But the election last night was a bit of a surprise when it came to this demographic.

Americans under the age of 30 were still the group most likely to support Harris – they did so by 8 points compared to Trump, so 52% to 44%. However, her lead among this group shrank massively from Biden’s lead of 25 points four years ago. In real terms, that’s an astonishing decline in the vote. Harris actually scored lower among young women than Biden, down from 65% in 2020 to 58% this year, and much poorer among young men, from 56% to 43%, with Trump enjoying an 11-point lead in this group. The figures are even higher among young men who are white and non-college educated, which is exactly the group of young people that I have been identifying in my work.

James believes that, while there are long-term reasons for these trends, Harris simply did not do enough to court the youth vote.

The Harris campaign offered very little to young people in general on the economy and the cost of living – all it did offer was the issue of abortion. This is certainly an important issue for most people, but the focus on one issue may even have exacerbated the exodus of some young men, marking it out as a campaign that was being run by a woman for women. Trump took advantage of this with his various appearances on talk shows and podcasts, talking about sport and appealing to this form of toxic masculinity that would be present in this group of young people. So, overall, Trump’s message and campaign to appeal to young male voters succeeded much better than most experts expected.

Trump’s second presidency and democracy

With Trump expected to try and concentrate more power into the presidency, what is the next step, asks Natasha Lindstaedt of Essex University.

The state will be hollowed out and increasingly more ineffective, unable or unwilling to deliver key services, like disaster aid. While this may seem harmless to some, Trump will undercut the expertise of executive agencies either by under-funding them or filling them with loyalists. Plans are in the works to fire 50,000 career civil servants. Hundreds of important regulations that ensure that there is clean air and water, which protect citizens from corporate greed, are likely to be rolled back.

Who voted for Donald Trump?

Trump’s political comeback is complete. But who, aside from young men, voted for him? Thomas Gift, an expert of US politics at University College London, says Trump was able to win the support of many voters outside of his core supporter base.

Well Trump, of course, was able to get his core base of MAGA supporters to back him and that is white, working-class Americans who have largely become disillusioned with the political status quo. At the same time, he was also able to make significant inroads with diverse constituencies, including Latinos and blacks.

Trump’s ground game in Georgia

Donald Trump declared victory after a string of wins in the crucial swing states of North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Katie Pruszynski of the University of Sheffield believes that Trump was given the edge in this state by promoting early voting.

Georgia had a record 4 million early voters in the state, which has really outstripped all previous early voting records here. It’s likely because of the really increased ground game that the Republicans were operating in Georgia, really encouraging their voters to get out and vote early using mail-in ballots, which they previously said were not trustworthy.

But that doesn’t mean the polls were quiet, says Katie, who was on the ground in Georgia over the election.

Polling stations had lines forming from 7am when the polls opened. It was a really bustling polling day. In Atlanta, the big news was that several polling stations had to be evacuated throughout the course of the day because of bomb threats that also hit states like Arizona as well. Those bomb threats turned out to be not credible.

Turnout high and voting peaceful

Dafydd Townley, teaching fellow in international security at University of Portsmouth, has written an overview of how the election went down, with turnout looking high and no major incidents of violence, despite what look like numerous bomb hoaxes with possible Russian origins.

Turnout has been impressive and initial speculation is that Trump has surpassed his rural support from 2020 while Democrat Kamala Harris only matched the suburban numbers that Biden achieved four years ago. NBC exit polls also showed Trump had more support from voters under 30 than any Republican candidate since 2008. … The greatest threat to the smooth running of the election on polling day seemed not to come from domestic perpetrators but from foreign interference, particularly in the crucial swing state races. Several polling stations in Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin were the victims of hoax bomb threats that caused temporary closures of the sites. The threats were believed to be sent by emails that were traced back to Russian email domains.

What it means for the rest of the world

Donald Trump is likely to put pressure on Nato members to support the end of the war in Ukraine, according to international security expert Stefan Wolff. He expects Trump to push Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to sit down and negotiate a peace agreement based on the current frontlines, meanwhile throwing support behind Israel.

Trump’s election will embolden Netanyahu to act. And this in turn would also strengthen Trump’s position towards Putin, who has come to depend on Iranian support for his war in Ukraine. Trump could offer to restrain Netanyahu in the future as a bargaining chip with Putin in his gamble to secure a deal on Ukraine.

Wolff adds that Trump may double down on his approach to China but also leave himself wiggle room.

A Trump White House is likely to increase import tariffs, and he has talked a great deal about using them to target China. But Trump is also just as likely to be open to pragmatic, transactional deals with Chinese president Xi Jinping.

Questions for Europe

Amelia Hadfield, head of politics at the University of Surrey, sets out some of the other key issues for Europe following Trump’s victory.

European governments obviously are going to be tripping over themselves, either preparing for what the impact is going to be of a retribution-led Trump administration, or changing really quickly their approach to him to be able to try at least to get him on side. One point, of course, is the previous tough talk in the first presidential administration on Nato. He threatened then, and I think he may very well threaten again to curtail American support and positioning for the military alliance because he has a completely different vision of what underpins European security as a whole, and a totally different vision of what encompasses allies and threats.

She also says that some countries, particularly big automotive export countries like Germany, are very vulnerable to Trump’s proposed economic policies.

He has, of course, proposed hitting China with 50% tariffs and then tariffs on all other imports of up to 20%, including for European countries. So they’re going to have to not only deal with that, but figure out whether they line up behind America on that, or whether they line up behind China on that as well. I think there’s going to be desperate sadness across Europe. The heads of state, apart from maybe Orban, who seems to be gloating right now, are really going to have to get their ducks in a row.

Economic consequences

Trump’s presidency could have economic ramifications beyond Europe, according to economist Conor O'Kane. He says prices for American consumers could be pushed up.

In very traditional Republican terms, he’s talking about tax breaks and reduced regulation. In terms of some of his specific pledges on the economy, he’s talking about getting rid of income taxation on tips and overtime. These things combined have the potential to be quite domestically inflationary, I would say. If he was to carry through on his pledge to deport 15 million migrants, that’s also potentially an enormous cost – I saw some figures recently that said it will cost [the US economy] about US$65 billion for every 2 million people that are expelled out of the country.

He also said that Trump’s economic policies have the potential to be extremely disruptive for the world economy.

The other key thing, I think, is that Trump’s argument that the president should have a greater say on interest rate policy might spook capital markets. Many central banks around the world have independent control of monetary policy, and that has all been done to reassure capital markets and international investors. I would say that moving away from that is potentially quite risky.

However, senior economics lecturer Renaud Foucart argues that Trump’s threat to introduce more tariffs on goods coming into the US is in some ways a continuation of Biden’s approach, and the problems in the global economy go far beyond Trump’s protectionism.

China, after decades of mostly export-based growth, must now deal with massive problems of industrial overcapacity. The country is now trying to encourage more domestic consumption and to diversify its trading partners. Europe, despite a very tight budget constraint, spends a lot of money in the subsidy race … All those subsidies are hurting the world economy and could have easily financed urgent needs such as the electrification of the entire African continent with solar panels and batteries.

Gender and voting patterns

Meredith Ralston, professor of women’s studies and political studies, Mount Saint Vincent University, Canada, is concerned about further erosion of women’s rights in the US.

Even though exit polls suggested a majority of women cast their ballots for Harris. Women apparently preferred Harris, but not by the margins her campaign had hoped. Trump’s appeal to young men increased as their apparent fears of being overtaken by women’s gains in equality were exploited.

How race has played into the campaign

Rhianna Garrett, PhD researcher and global coordinator of the critical mixed race studies executive board at Loughborough University, says that Trump’s campaign has been “littered with attempts to weaponise” the multiracial heritage of his Democrat opponent Kamala Harris.

Much of this has been a dog-whistle attempt to stir up his own base, partly with fairly blatant appeals to latent feelings of racism, but also as a tool to position Harris as deceiving and untrustworthy by apparently blurring and shifting her own background. In August, not long after Harris took over the Democrat ticket from Biden, Trump appeared at the National Association of Black Journalists conference when he wrongfully claimed that Harris was changing her identity, stating: “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black, So I don’t know. Is she Indian or is she Black?”. For her part, Harris’s campaign has also used her multiracial heritage to further their political agendas. On the White House website, she is described as “the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American” to hold a vice-presidential position, which has effectively attempted to position her as a winner. Harris herself has also foregrounded “race” on her campaign website. In attempt to attack Trump’s campaign, she strategically aims to promote Black and Latino men specifically, as well as women’s rights. These are key voter groups she has aimed to mobilise through identity politics.

Trump and winning male voters

Donald Trump widened his appeal to male voters in this election, with polling indicating that he was picking up more support from Black and Latino men, as well as more young men more widely.

One reason for this may be that in 2024 young men are more conservative than any other group in the US. Another reason why gender has become a divisive issue is the overturning of Roe v Wade, the legal case that gave American women abortion rights.

Getty Images Donald Trump addressed supporters in the early hours of Wednesday after the election results became clear

In the build-up to Tuesday’s US election, claims of voter fraud flooded social media - but as Donald Trump’s victory crystallised, the chatter largely subsided. The claims didn’t stop entirely, however. A number of right-wing influencers and organisations pushing stories about “cheating” and a “rigged” vote pointed to incomplete vote totals and continued to repeat discredited theories about the 2020 election. And disappointed Democratic Party supporters developed their own unsubstantiated voter fraud theories, some of which went viral on X, formerly Twitter, and other platforms. The reach of the posts is nowhere near the deluge of content that circulated after Trump lost the 2020 election.

And with no support from losing candidate Kamala Harris or other Democratic Party officials, the chances seem slim of a large-scale movement developing along the lines of the “Stop the Steal” drive four years ago, which culminated in a riot at the US Capitol.

How did fraud claims develop on election day?

The BBC tracked a huge wave of pre-election fraud claims that carried through election day and into the evening. These included claims of the vote being “stolen” in some key swing states, with exaggerated takes on real events being used in some cases to bolster the allegations. Early on election day in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold, there were problems with voting machines malfunctioning. The issues were fixed and voting hours in the affected areas were extended. However, many online immediately used the story to suggest nefarious activities were taking place. One post at 08:45 local time on Tuesday said: “The election steal is happening!” Other rumours were spread in posts that popped up throughout the day, including one at around 14:00, which claimed ballots in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, had been pre-marked for Kamala Harris. In Milwaukee, the biggest city in the swing state of Wisconsin, elections officials made a decision to re-run around 30,000 ballots out of an “abundance of caution”, after doors on the back of voting machines were left open. Once the count was completed, it showed that support for Harris had dropped compared with Joe Biden's four years earlier. Like many of the pro-Trump posters, Harris supporters pointed to real but isolated events - fires at ballot drop boxes in Washington and Oregon, and a series of fake bomb threats that disrupted voting at several polling locations on election day - as evidence of widespread voter fraud. However, there’s no evidence that the incidents significantly altered the vote or changed the outcome. Several posts from Democratic Party activists questioning the result went viral and were seen by millions on X and other platforms. Pam Keith, a Harris supporter in Florida, posted: “Is it possible that the machines were hacked to switch the tallies from Harris to Trump?” Her message was seen more than one million times on X, according to the site’s metrics. The BBC has reached out to her for comment. Unlike Trump’s campaign in 2020, however, the Harris campaign and top Democratic Party officials have not endorsed allegations of cheating or voter fraud. On election day, fraud rumours also came from President-elect Trump himself, who has repeatedly argued from the outset of his political career that the voting system is unfairly stacked against him. Just after 16:30 Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!” The now president-elect did not give any details and the Philadelphia Police Department told BBC Verify they were not aware of what Trump was referring to. Seth Bluestein, the Republican City Commissioner in Philadelphia, posted on X: ""There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure."" Trump has not repeated the fraud allegations since election day. We have contacted several hugely influential accounts that regularly posted about election fraud claims in the build-up to the vote, but none of them replied. With data firm NodeXL, the BBC tracked accounts that engaged with Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Elon Musk on X around election day. Posts mentioning vote fraud peaked at 15:00 EST on 5 November - but then dropped off significantly that evening and into the next day as polls closed and results came in.

Claims continue to circulate

However, some organisations and activists who promoted voter fraud allegations in the past continued to repeat debunked rumours even after the results became clear. Emerald Robinson, a former reporter with right-wing TV networks and a pro-Trump influencer with more than 750,000 followers on X, insisted that Democrats were “cheating right now” and posted: “I always told people the voting machines were rigged!” More generally, reaction from pro-Trump groups and influencers who previously hyped up vote fraud claims varied - from silence on the issue, to continued insistence that the 2020 vote was marred by fraud. The BBC contacted Ms Robinson for comment.

As she sweeps up broken glass outside her shop, Inna knows her country’s future is in the hands of Americans voting more than 5,000 miles away. “We hope that the woman, Kamala Harris, will win and support us,” she says. A Russian bomb had shattered her shop windows - a common occurrence in the city of Zaporizhzhia. There’s a 10-metre (32ft) wide crater in the middle of the road. “Of course we are worried about the outcome [of the election],” she adds. “We want to defeat the enemy!” For Ukraine to have a remote chance of doing that, it needs the help of the US.

It was here in 2023, on this south-eastern part of the front line, where Ukraine launched a counteroffensive it hoped would force out the Russian invaders. Instead, after little to no progress, Ukraine’s ambitions have switched to survival. Missiles and glide bombs slam into towns and cities daily, and its soldiers weather constant Russian attacks. Election polls - is Harris or Trump winning?

How the election could change the world While Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has suggested military aid would continue if she emerged the victor, her powers could be constrained by a Republican-run Congress. And the pipeline of military support, which so far totals more than $50bn, is looking less likely to be sustained under a second term for Donald Trump. Whoever becomes the next US president will have a profound impact on Ukraine’s borders and everyone who lives within them.

BBC/Sara Monetta Russian strikes like the one which shattered Inna's shop windows are a horrifying fact of life in Zaporizhzhia

If, for example, they forced Ukraine to give up land and freeze the front lines, then regions like Zaporizhzhia could become suddenly divided like North and South Korea after the ceasefire that halted fighting - but never officially ended the war there - in the 1950s. Trump has said he would “work out something” to settle the war and suggested Ukraine may have to give up some land. A second US option would be to pull its support completely, which would mean over time that Russian forces could eventually engulf the entire region and even more of Ukraine beyond it. The third scenario of Ukraine completely liberating its occupied territories is looking less and less likely.

It’s this lack of battlefield progress that has made the merits of supporting Ukrainian troops like Andriy increasingly up for debate across the Atlantic. He’s in charge of his unit’s fleet of US-made armoured vehicles on the front lines. When they’re not used for moving soldiers, they sit under camouflage netting along tree lines. “If aid stops or slows, the burden will fall on the shoulders of the infantry,” he explains. “We’ll fight with what we have, but everyone knows Ukraine can’t do it on its own.” Russian drones hunt civilians, evidence suggests

WATCH: Putin challenged over Ukraine war by BBC reporter Andriy and his fellow Ukrainians are nervously awaiting the US vote on 5 November. The uncertainty is stifling battlefield ambitions and frustrating political efforts to secure more help. Western allies often look to America’s example when deciding how or whether to support Kyiv’s war effort. “When we hear how one candidate, who is less willing to help us, is leading in the polls, it’s upsetting and frustrating,” says Andriy. “But we’re not going anywhere.”

BBC/Maarten Lernout Ukraine's soldiers know that the US election could drastically affect their fortunes on the battlefield

Amidst the autumnal farmland, the soldiers are keen to demonstrate the American kit they use - drones, grenade launchers and mounted machine guns. All, they say, far superior to their Soviet-era alternatives. Whether it’s through Ukraine’s natural resources or business ventures, President Zelensky is also trying to pitch his country as an investment opportunity to his allies. Drone pilot Serhiy explains how they can give direct feedback to Western manufacturers. “We have an online chat with them, and we make suggestions,” he says with a grin. “Improvements are already happening.” As demonstrated with drone manufacturing, the war in Ukraine is forcing innovations domestically. It’s also allowing Western companies to test their products in an active warzone.

BBC/Maarten Lernout The outgoing Biden administration has recently pledged another $800m in military aid to Ukraine, including weapons and vehicles

Billions of dollars of Western aid has also driven reforms in some areas of government. Kyiv wants to show it’s a horse worth backing. The question is whether these advances will be eclipsed by a conflict increasingly going Russia’s way. With an army typically only being as strong as its society, we head to meet someone who experienced Russian brutality first-hand. Lyubov’s daughter and grandchildren fled to the US at the start of the full-scale invasion. We last met in her front-line village of Komyshuvakha two years ago, after the invading troops had destroyed her home.

BBC/Maarten Lernout Lyubov thinks Ukraine should not stop fighting Russia until it has freed all its territory

This time, she seemed happier, despite living close to the fighting for so long. In the warm confines of her new flat, I ask her whether Ukraine should negotiate to end the war. “What about those who gave their lives?” she replies. “I see the end of the war only when we reach the 1991 borders of our country, when Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk were ours.” There is almost endless coverage of the US election on Ukrainian news programmes, with war projections based on the potential winner. Kamala Harris is undoubtedly seen as Ukraine’s preferred candidate, and journalists are trying to combat Russian disinformation against her.

Getty Images Zelensky and Trump met in New York in September

But across Ukraine’s south and east, we find a growing number of people who want the war to end immediately, and see a Donald Trump presidency as the best chance of bringing respite. We spoke to many of these people around the embattled eastern town of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces are inching closer. There’s a feeling here that Ukraine should have negotiated at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, to prevent the death and destruction they’ve seen since. Both sides engaged in talks in those early months of 2022. But evidence of alleged Russian war crimes halted attempts at diplomacy, and strengthened Ukraine’s resolve to fight on. “Death is not worth territory,” as one woman put it. “We have to stop this war, and Trump is the person who knows how to do that.” Eleven years of Russian aggression is enough for some. For the politicians in Ukraine’s parliament, it is not an openly shared sentiment. While there is still cross-party support to keep fighting, President Zelensky’s “victory plan” has been criticised for not having a clearer timeline.

As for Lyubov, she certainly wasn’t going to voice her preference on who should win the White House: “I would like a true friend of Ukraine to win, who will continue to support us. But who it is going to be, I cannot tell you.” As much as I admire Lyubov’s inner steel, she reflects an increasingly popular and uncomfortable contradiction: a desire for Russia’s defeat, while also wanting the bloodshed to end as soon as possible. The pendulum between US interventionism and isolationism is closely watched and felt in Ukraine. Ever since it voted overwhelmingly to be an independent country in 1991 during the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has had to fight for its sovereignty. It’s found itself on the edge of a geopolitical tectonic plate, trying to align itself with the West as Russia pulls it the other way. Moscow’s full-scale invasion means Ukraine needs the helping hand of America to stop it from being torn apart.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,"Five closest US elections: When California, New York were swing states - Al Jazeera English","From snubbing a senator in a California hotel to surviving a scandal over an illegitimate child – how candidates have weathered ultra-close elections through history.

Voters across 50 states in the US are casting ballots to choose the 47th president of the country in an election that has turned into a neck-and-neck battle between the two main candidates.

So far, election analysts say this year’s presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is too close to call.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s daily polls tracker, Harris has a 1.2-point lead over Trump nationally. But Trump has begun narrowing the gap in recent days, and has slim leads in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.

Yet it’s not the first time that the path to the United States presidency has essentially seen a dead heat between candidates. Previous closely fought presidential elections have also seen California and New York – not the typical swing states – and also the US Supreme Court play a role in deciding the winner.

Let’s take a look at five presidential races in US history that came down to a few thousand votes:

1824: US House of Representatives weighs in

The 1824 battle for the White House was a turning point in American history as four candidates, all from the same political party, competed for the top post and the US House of Representatives had to pick the winner.

After the death of Alexander Hamilton, America’s first US secretary of the treasury and a founding father in 1804, the Democratic-Republic Party which had defeated Hamilton’s Federalist Party, was confident of its easy path to presidency.

But picking one presidential candidate proved to be hard for members of the party, and John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson and William H Crawford, all from the Democratic-Republic Party, campaigned across the country, hoping to become the next president.

When polls closed across all 28 US states (the country now has 50), Jackson was in the lead with 99 electoral votes, followed by Adams who received 84, Crawford who got 41 and Clay who got 37 electoral votes.

But no candidate received a majority.

According to the Twelfth Amendment of the US Constitution, in such a case, “the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President”. Moreover, since the Constitution also stated that only the top three in the race move ahead, Clay was disqualified.

For around a year, each candidate lobbied members of the House of Representatives – the lower chamber of the US Congress, including Clay, who was the speaker of the House.

Finally, on February 9, 1825, the House voted to elect Adams as the president of the US, a result that came to form after a critical vote by Clay. According to the US National Archives, he shelved his support for his home state candidate Jefferson, and picked Adams.

Adams, who was also the son of John Adams, the second president of the US, eventually picked Clay as his secretary of state.

This did not go down well with Jackson, and he accused Clay and Adams of engaging in a “corrupt bargain” and sought an election rematch.

During the next presidential election in 1828, Jackson managed to beat Adams and became the president. But his anger towards Clay remained.

According to a US Senate Historical Highlight brief, towards the end of his presidency, when Jackson was asked if he had any regrets, he said: “I regret I was unable to shoot Henry Clay…”

1876: One vote changed the game

Half a century later, the presidential election was decided by one vote in the Electoral Commission – a group created by the US Congress comprising 14 congressmen and a Supreme Court justice, to solve the disputed presidential race.

The 1876 election saw Republican Party candidate Rutherford B Hayes, who had also fought in the US Civil War, up against Democratic Party candidate Samuel Tilden, a politician known for his anti-corruption policies. Moreover, this being an era when the US was just recovering from the 18th-century Civil War and Congress had passed several Reconstruction Acts, one of the goals was ensuring that the voting rights of Black Americans were secure.

But in many southern states like Louisiana, white Americans wanted a return to white supremacy and had been protesting against efforts to enfranchise Black people in the country since 1873. Describing the situation in the south, in his essay Black Reconstruction: An Essay Toward a History of the Part Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880, historian WEB Du Bois wrote: “The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.”

By the 1876 presidential election, the Black vote had almost been repressed and this led to the Democratic Party becoming popular among Black voters in the South, especially in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida.

According to White House archives, “The popular vote apparently was 4,300,000 for Tilden to 4,036,000 for Hayes”. However, Hayes’s chances of election depended upon contested electoral votes in Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida. So the Republicans demanded a recount.

After months of uncertainty, in 1877, Congress weighed in and formed the Electoral Commission, which voted in favour of Hayes. After the commission’s vote, Hayes defeated Tilden by one vote: 185 electoral votes to 184.

On winning the elections, Hayes pledged to protect Black Americans’ rights in the South and also encouraged the “restoration of wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government”.

1884: When New York was a swing state

New York has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party in more recent years. But in 1884, the state was a swing state and played a critical role in deciding the winner of the presidential race, which was also marred by a scandal.

Republican candidate James G Blaine was up against the Democratic Party’s Grover Cleveland, who was also the mayor of New York.

Back then, the US was rife with economic drama and filled with corrupt money-making deals. The Democratic Party was popular in the southern states in the US and Cleveland had impressed people in New York with his anti-corruption policies. He and the Democratic Party believed they had an easy path to success.

But just days after Cleveland was nominated as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party on July 11, the Buffalo Evening Telegraph reported that he had fathered a son with a woman named Maria Halpin. According to the US Library of Congress, the child had been given away to an orphanage since Cleveland was not certain the child was his. But he helped the child financially until he was adopted.

The Republican Party latched on to this story as its candidate, Blaine, had been painted by the Democratic Party campaign as a liar and politician involved in cash deals.

In turn, according to the Library of Congress, a popular satirical publication called The Judge ran a cartoon of Cleveland titled: “Ma, Ma, Where’s my Pa?”

While Cleveland was running on the slogan, “Tell the truth”, the scandal dented his support base in New York, the most populous state carrying 36 electoral votes back then.

When polls closed, Cleveland’s lead was narrow in the state and he received 563,048 votes in New York to Blaine’s 562,001.

In the end, the few thousand votes decided by New York together with the combined support of reform Republicans who disliked Blaine helped Cleveland win.

According to White House archives, President Cleveland pursued a policy of not offering favours to any economic groups. He was also said not to particularly enjoy the comforts of the White House.

As president, he once wrote to a friend: “I must go to dinner…but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring, a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis’ instead of the French stuff I shall find.”

1916: California calls the shots

In 1916, a drink in Long Beach, California was what it took to upend the US presidential race between Woodrow Wilson, from the Democratic Party, and Republican candidate Charles Evans Hughes.

Back then, the western US state known for its picturesque beaches and redwood forests had 13 electoral votes and was a swing state. Currently, being the most populous state, it has 54 electoral votes – the most in the US.

Moreover, besides presidential candidates, two members of California’s Republican Party – Hiram Johnson and conservative William Booth – hoped to win seats in the US Senate.

According to the History Channel, while campaigning in Long Beach, Hughes was told that Johnson was staying in the same hotel as him but did not engage with Johnson or offer him a drink.

Johnson wasn’t very pleased and did not offer his support to Hughes in California, meaning Wilson won the swing state by around 3,000 votes. Wilson also won the presidency.

2000: US Supreme Court decides

The presidential race of 2000 saw Democrat Al Gore, the vice president of the country back then, and Republican George W Bush, who was the governor of Texas, compete. The contest ultimately came down to Florida — and the US Supreme Court had to weigh in.

On election night, as polls closed across the country, it became clear the 25 electoral votes in Florida, a swing state, would determine the winner. When results from the Sunshine State trickled in, TV networks across the US began announcing that Bush had won the state’s electoral votes. Gore called Bush to congratulate him, but soon withdrew his concession when Bush’s lead in Florida began dropping.

Lawyers from the Democratic Party and Republican Party began a legal fight over the votes, with Gore’s lawyers also demanding a recount.

The battle went to the country’s Supreme Court and, after weeks of uncertainty, the court said the recounts could not be established and voted 5-4 in favour of Bush’s victory.

The Bush versus Gore election continues to haunt the country’s court, which has often stayed away from elections.

In 2013, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who voted with the majority in the Supreme Court, told the Chicago Tribune that the “court took the case and decided it at a time when it was still a big election issue. … Maybe the court should have said, ‘We’re not going to take it, goodbye’.”","Five closest US elections: When California, New York were swing states  Al Jazeera English",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/five-closest-us-elections-when-california-new-york-were-swing-states

In a race against time, United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have traversed the nation’s swing states in a bid to woo undecided voters and bag crucial Electoral College votes that could decide the winner of the 2024 US election.

Even if both White House hopefuls secure their traditional blue (Democratic) and red (Republican) states, the Electoral College votes from those are unlikely to be enough for either candidate to reach the magic number of 270 needed to cross the threshold to victory.

This year, the seven closely watched swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and North Carolina.

Here’s a brief look at some of the key issues shaping the swing states and both candidates’ stance on them:

Arizona: Immigration

Since 1952, Arizona has voted Republican in all but one election (1996) before Joe Biden flipped it in 2020 for the Democrats.

This time, polls show Trump leading marginally.

Arizona is a border state, and many polls have shown immigration and border control as key issues for many of its residents. In a May poll by CBS News, for instance, 52 percent of the respondents said recently arrived immigrants from Mexico had worsened living conditions for them.

Here is how both candidates plan to tackle immigration and border security:

Harris on immigration

Vice President Harris believes the US immigration system is “broken” and in need of “comprehensive reform”. While she has pledged support for a border security bill that would increase detection technology to intercept drugs and has promised to add 1,500 border security agents, Harris has also promised an “earned pathway to citizenship” and an increase in the number of employment-based and family visas.

Trump on immigration

Overall, Trump blames immigrants for rising housing, education and healthcare costs.

Trump’s plans include deporting millions of undocumented migrants by force, sealing the border to stop the “migrant invasion” by using the military on the US-Mexico border, and constructing detention facilities.

The former president wants to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their immigration cases have been resolved. Trump also wants to end birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents.

The Republican candidate wants to impose ideological screening of immigrants but has proposed automatic green cards for foreign graduates of US universities.

Georgia: Cost of living

Traditionally a Republican stronghold, this southern state went Democratic in 2020 – but only just. The votes in Georgia were counted three times, including once by hand, but that did not stop Trump from controversially attempting to overturn the results.

This time, perceptions about the state of the economy could determine how Georgia votes. A September poll by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, in partnership with the UK newspaper, The Telegraph, found that 41 percent of Georgia’s voters viewed the economy as the single biggest issue for them.

How do both candidates propose to ease the burden of inflation – which is not yet down to pre-COVID-19 levels?

Harris on cost of living

Harris has promised to cut taxes for “more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans” by restoring Child Tax Credits and Earned Income Tax Credits. She has also pledged to increase Long-Term Capital Gains Tax from 20 percent to 28 percent, and the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent to pay for this.

In order to help lower the cost of living, the vice president has proposed a federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries.

Trump on cost of living

Trump has pledged to “end inflation” and significantly increase the Child Tax Credit while cutting government spending and bringing down the corporate tax rate to 15 percent.

Michigan: Israel’s war on Gaza

The state of Michigan was a key stop in Vice President Harris’s last stretch of campaigning and here is why: Harris wanted to make a last-ditch effort to win over the continent’s largest Arab-American community that has been angered by the Biden-Harris administration’s unequivocal support for Israel in its war on Gaza.

While pre-poll numbers show Harris with a slender lead in the state, Trump will hope that his “Muslim supporters” will help him win in Michigan.

More than 100,000 uncommitted voters in the state have declared that they will not endorse Harris or Trump and some may opt for the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, who has pledged to press for a ceasefire and halt weapons sales to Israel.

Harris on Gaza

While Harris has promised to work towards ending the war in Gaza, “allow Palestinians to realise their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination”, she has also backed Israel’s “right to defend itself” and has rejected an arms embargo on the US ally in the Middle East.

Trump on Gaza

Trump has not revealed specific details about what he would do on the issue of Gaza. However, during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July, Trump urged the Israeli leader to “get his victory” over Hamas. He said the killings in Gaza had to stop but that Netanyahu “knows what he’s doing”.

That rhetoric is in line with Trump’s actions during his first run as president. His government recognised the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, prompting anger among Palestinians. He negotiated “normalisation” deals between Israel and several Arab nations under the Abraham Accords and he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel also opposed.

However, he has also argued that he will push for peace – and get it.

Pennsylvania: Fracking

President Joe Biden’s home state of Pennsylvania offers 19 Electoral College votes, the most among battleground states – and could prove to be the state that determines who wins the election.

In recent days, Harris has gained ground there, according to Democratic strategist Anish Mohanty. “Things have changed in this election over the last few days and the vice president has pulled off her campaign effectively,” Mohanty told Al Jazeera shortly after polls opened on the East Coast. Mohanty alluded to racist remarks against Puerto Rico by a comedian at a Trump rally recently as a turning point for the campaign: Pennsylvania is home to more than 480,000 Puerto Ricans.

But in addition to concerns over political divisiveness, immigration, the state of the economy and abortion, Pennsylvanians are concerned about an issue specific to their state: Fracking.

Fracking is a form of oil and gas production that environmentalists say is bad for the environment but which is the source of a huge number of jobs around the state. The practice causes earth tremors and has a high environmental cost since the procedure consumes large amounts of water, in addition to releasing methane, a greenhouse gas.

An October poll found that the state’s residents are divided on fracking: 58 percent backed it, while 42 percent opposed it.

Harris on fracking

Harris famously opposed fracking when she ran for president four years ago but in late July, her campaign officials confirmed that she will not seek to ban fracking if elected.

Harris wrapped up her campaign with a final, glitzy event in Philadelphia, where iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey introduced her.

The vice president called on “everyone” in Pennsylvania to vote.

“You are going to make the difference in this election,” she told her supporters.

Trump on fracking

Meanwhile, Trump supports fracking and has said he will once again withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and will also remove environmental regulations, such as restrictions on fossil fuel production, deemed “burdensome”. He had withdrawn from the Paris pact during his first term – President Joe Biden had recommitted the US to the agreement when he came to power.

Wisconsin: Healthcare

Up until 2016, Wisconsin had been a reliably blue state for decades, but Trump was able to spring a surprise, beating Hillary Clinton by wooing mostly white, working-class voters who were unhappy about wages, poverty and rising healthcare costs.

Four years later, Biden was able to bring the state back into the Democratic Party’s fold.

This time, multiple opinion polls have suggested that healthcare is the most pressing issue for voters, in a state that has been badly affected by the country’s opioid crisis.

Harris on healthcare

Harris has said she will lower the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, strengthen the Affordable Care Act, and lower healthcare premiums. If elected, she will also work with states to cancel medical debt for more people, she has promised.

Trump on healthcare

On the other hand, Trump says he is “looking at alternatives” to the Affordable Care Act, which he calls too expensive.

Nevada: Unemployment

While Nevada has the fewest Electoral College votes – six – among the swing states, they could still be crucial in such a close race.

Nevada suffers from the highest unemployment rate among all US states – only Washington, DC has a higher joblessness rate – as well as high costs of living.

Harris on unemployment

Harris has promised to review which federal jobs require a college degree if elected president.

“We need to get in front of this idea that only high-skilled jobs require college degrees,” Harris said at a rally in October, promising she would tackle this on “day one” of her presidency.

Trump on unemployment

At his October rally in Nevada, Trump promised to tackle inflation, but in a more recent rally this month, did not address the issue of unemployment.

Al Jazeera’s John Holman, who attended Trump’s November rally in Nevada, noted that while Trump concentrated on migration, the primary concern for voters in Nevada is the economy.

“This is the state with the highest unemployment in the US. It’s been hit hard with inflation. Gas prices, in particular, are high, and it’s a state that has never completely recovered from the pandemic,” Holman said.

North Carolina: Abortion

North Carolina is the only one of this year’s swing states to have been won by Trump in 2020 and although Harris does not necessarily need to win North Carolina, any scenario in which she does will make her path to 270 a lot easier.

Trump can also get to 270 without North Carolina but doing so will be very difficult.

Abortion is a key issue in the state, according to polls. The state reduced the legal limit for abortions from 20 weeks of pregnancy to just 12 weeks in 2023 after the US Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade court ruling granting the right to abortion.

The ruling left the issue largely unresolved and turned the current election into a referendum on fundamental rights for women.

Democrats are hoping that the issue of abortion will motivate white women, who have historically favoured Republicans and 60 percent of whom voted for Trump in 2020, to now vote for Harris instead.

Harris on abortion

The vice president, hoping to become the first female president in the country’s history, has said she will prevent a national abortion ban from becoming law and will sign any bill passed by Congress that restores the legality of abortion nationwide.

Trump on abortion

Meanwhile, Trump has said abortion laws are for individual states to decide and said he will not sign a national abortion ban. However, he has not signalled that he would oppose states – like North Carolina – adopting restrictive measures against reproductive rights.",US election 2024: The key issues driving votes in the swing states  Al Jazeera English,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/us-election-2024-the-key-issues-driving-votes-in-the-swing-states
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,How voting demographics changed between 2020 and 2024 presidential elections - NBC Washington,"For the second time in three elections, America has elected Donald Trump as its president.

The former president won his first election in 2016 over Hillary Clinton before losing out to current President Joe Biden in the 2020 race. This year, Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to earn a second term as commander-in-chief, becoming the second president in American history to win back the title after previously being voted out of office.

What changed for Trump between the 2020 and 2024 elections?

NBC News, in conjunction with a consortium of news organizations, conducted exit polls across 10 key states both at polling locations and over the phone. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",US elections,Further US election analysis: Hispanics and young men swung big to Trump - The Conversation,"Republican Donald Trump won the United States presidential election by 312 electoral votes to 226 for Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump carried the seven key states of Georgia (16 electoral votes), North Carolina (16), Arizona (11), Nevada (six), Wisconsin (ten), Michigan (15) and Pennsylvania (19).

Arizona and Nevada have not yet been called for Trump, but he will win them both. Joe Biden had defeated Trump by 306 electoral votes to 232 in 2020. At this election, Trump gained Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada. He won all the states he won in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, plus Nevada.

Analyst Nate Silver’s final forecast had given Trump a 20% chance to win all seven key states. The pre-election polls did not have to be very wrong for Trump to do this.

Trump leads in the national popular vote by 50.7–47.7. When The New York Times Needle was turned off early Wednesday morning US time, Trump was forecast to win the popular vote by 1.5%. There are many more votes left in Democratic strongholds like California.

This will be the first time a Republican has won the popular vote since 2004. In 2020, Biden won the popular vote against Trump by 51.3–46.8.

The New York Times said 90% of counties with nearly complete results as of Wednesday morning had swung to Trump since 2020. The swing was greatest in counties with over 25% Hispanics, with a shift since 2020 of 9.5 points towards Trump. There were similar swings to Trump in urban and suburban counties.

New York City has five boroughs. Silver said whites have just 9% of the population in the Bronx and 24% in Queens, with Hispanics having a plurality of the population in both boroughs.

In the 2012 presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney won just 8% of the vote against Democrat Barack Obama in the Bronx and 20% in Queens. There was virtually no swing to Trump in 2016 from Romney, but he has had big swings in his favour in the following two elections. Trump won 27% in the Bronx and 38% in Queens on Tuesday.

I wrote on Wednesday about a huge shift since 2016 in Trump’s favour in Florida’s Miami-Dade county, which is heavily Hispanic. Democrats can’t rely on the Hispanic vote anymore.

The Wall Street Journal said that according to exit polls, Trump won men aged 18–29 by 55–42. In 2020, Biden won this demographic by 56–41.

As no county’s population is of young men only, county-level data cannot be used to extrapolate how young men voted, and exit polls are flawed. But if this huge swing to Trump among young men is true, it probably reflects a backlash against feminism.

Congressional elections

Republicans have won the Senate by 52–45 over Democrats (including allied independents), gaining three states that Trump won easily: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. However, Democrats have won or are leading in four of the five presidential key states that Trump won that also held Senate contests (Pennsylvania is the exception).

If the contests in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania go to the current leader, Republicans will win a 53–47 Senate majority. If Democrats have a very good 2026 midterm election, they may regain Senate control. Republicans will be defending 21 of the 34 seats up for election in 2026.

In the House of Representatives, Republicans lead Democrats by 210 seats to 198 with 218 needed for a majority. If uncalled races are assigned to current leaders, Republicans currently lead by 224–211. However, some seats still have many votes left to count, and Democrats will hope to reverse some Republican leads.

Australian Essential poll gave Harris a 41–33 lead over Trump

In an Australian federal Essential poll that was conducted before the US election (October 30 to November 3) from a sample of 1,131, Harris led Trump by 41–33. This contrasts with a Resolve poll in early October that gave Harris a 52–21 lead. By 43–29, respondents thought a Trump presidency would be bad for Australia.

On Australian voting intentions, the Coalition remained ahead by 49–47 including undecided (48–46 in late October). This was despite a primary vote movement to Labor, who were up three to 31%, with the Coalition down one to 34%, the Greens steady on 12%, One Nation up two to 9%, the UAP steady at 2%, all Others down one to 8% and undecided down one to 5%.

On abortion, 41% thought it should be legal in all cases, 38% legal in most cases, 14% illegal in most cases and 7% illegal in all cases. At least 58% thought politicians should not accept access to various special events and benefits.

Interest in the Melbourne Cup horse race has recovered since last year. Now 16% (up five since November 2023) say they have high interest, 30% moderate interest (up six), 26% little interest (down one) and 26% no interest (down nine). By 52–48, respondents said they would not bet on the Cup (61–39 last year).

Morgan poll: Labor just ahead

A national Morgan poll, conducted October 21–27 from a sample of 1,687, gave Labor a 50.5–49.5 lead, a 1.5-point gain for the Coalition since the October 14–20 Morgan poll that appeared to be a pro-Labor outlier.

Primary votes were 37.5% Coalition (up one), 30% Labor (down two), 14% Greens (up 0.5), 5.5% One Nation (steady), 9% independents (steady) and 4% others (up 0.5).

The headline figure uses respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by 51.5–48.5, a 1.5-point gain for the Coalition.",Further US election analysis: Hispanics and young men swung big to Trump  The Conversation,The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/further-us-election-analysis-hispanics-and-young-men-swung-big-to-trump-243142

"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",US elections,US presidential election 2024: How the Electoral College works - Le Monde,"ExplainerIn the United States, an electoral college of 538 members is designated by the states, based on their population. These electors vote for the president in the months following election day.

On November 5, American voters will go to the polls to choose their president for the next four years. However, unlike in France, the American system is indirect. Voters do not nominate a person but rather the political affiliation of their state's electors. These electors form the Electoral College responsible for officially designating the head of the federal state. This ""second presidential election"" will be held on December 17.

In almost all states (48 out of 50, plus the District of Columbia, which is not a state but is represented in the Electoral College), when a candidate has a majority, he or she ""wins"" all the electors. This means that with 50% of the vote plus one, the leading candidate sends all the electors in his or her favor to the Electoral College. This is known as the winner-take-all rule.

Who can be an elector?

Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution states that the president and vice president are chosen by electors ""in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,"" but without advising or listing any manner. However, the article does specify that ""no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector."" In practice, electors are often figures who have rendered a service to the party or candidate: party members, lobbyists, local officials or even retired political staff. Bill Clinton, in 2016, served as an elector for his wife, Hillary Clinton.

Basically, before the actual election, each party nominates potential electors in every state.

How many electors are there?

There are 538 electors in the Electoral College, so you need the support of 270 of them to win the presidential election. States have the same number of electors as their number of members in the Congress. The number of electors is therefore proportional to the population of each state, with a minimum of three electors. This method of calculation leads to a slight over-representation of sparsely populated states, such as Alaska, Wyoming and Vermont, which have three electors for 733,536, 586,485 and 647,818 inhabitants, respectively. This means they have more than four electors per million inhabitants In contrast, the majority of states have an average of one or two electors per million inhabitants.

Following a population census, the distribution of electors has changed slightly for 2024: California has lost one, as have Montana, North Carolina and New York, while Texas has gained two. Additionally, the influence of Florida and Colorado gained one vote.

Ohio Michigan Washington Colorado DC --> Florida Georgia North Carolina New York Pennsylvania Hawaii Texas Arizona

The political balance in most states virtually guarantees victory for one side or the other (California, Colorado and New York have historically voted for the Democrats, while Alaska, Idaho and Alabama have gone for the Republicans). Candidates visit these states less often, since victory is either a foregone conclusion or almost impossible.

Is an elector obliged to respect the vote of their state?

Thirty-three states as well as the District of Columbia have laws requiring electors to follow the popular vote in order to avoid a ""faithless elector"" situation. These laws may impose penalties such as a $500 fine and cancellation of the vote in states like North Carolina, or the appointment of a substitute elector in states like Montana, Nevada and Washington.

Given that electors are designated by the parties or by the candidates, instances of electors not voting as expected are uncommon, but there have been a few cases. For example, in the 2000 election, Democratic elector Barbara Lett-Simmons abstained from voting rather than casting her vote for Al Gore. This incident did not affect the election outcome, as Republican George W. Bush won with 271 votes out of 538.

Is it possible to win in terms of vote numbers and have a minority of electors?

The US presidential election is an indirect election, so it's possible to win the largest share of the vote nationwide (the popular vote), but not win a majority of electors in the electoral college.

In US history, this has happened five times, including twice in the 21st century: in 2000, Democrat Al Gore received 543,895 more votes than Republican George W. Bush and in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton received 2.86 million more votes than Republican Donald Trump.",US presidential election 2024: How the Electoral College works  Le Monde ,Le Monde,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2024/10/29/us-presidential-election-2024-how-the-electoral-college-works_6730922_8.html
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Trump wins the White House in a political comeback rooted in appeals to frustrated voters - The Associated Press,"Follow AP’s coverage of Donald Trump’s transition back to the White House.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States on Wednesday, an extraordinary comeback for a former president who refused to accept defeat four years ago, sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was convicted of felony charges and survived two assassination attempts.

With a win in Wisconsin, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency. He won Michigan on Wednesday afternoon, sweeping the “blue wall” along with Pennsylvania — the one-time Democrat-leaning, swing states that all went for Trump in 2016 before flipping to President Joe Biden in 2020.

His Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, called Trump on Wednesday afternoon to concede the race and congratulate him. A short time later, Biden also called Trump to congratulate him and to invite the president-elect to the White House, formally kicking off the transition ahead of Inauguration Day, the White House said. Biden also called Harris.

Foreign leaders called Trump too, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron.

The victory validates Trump’s bare-knuckles approach to politics. He had attacked Harris in deeply personal – often misogynistic and racist – terms as he pushed an apocalyptic picture of a country overrun by violent migrants. The coarse rhetoric, paired with an image of hypermasculinity, resonated with angry voters – particularly men – in a deeply polarized nation.

“I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” Trump told throngs of cheering supporters in Florida even before his victory was confirmed.

In state after state, Trump outperformed what he did in the 2020 election while Harris failed to do as well as Joe Biden did in winning the presidency four years ago. Upon taking office again, Trump will work with a Senate that will now be in Republican hands, while control of the House hadn’t been determined.

“We’ve been through so much together, and today you showed up in record numbers to deliver a victory,” Trump said. “This was something special and we’re going to pay you back,” he said.

The U.S. stock market, Elon Musk’s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher Wednesday, as investors looked favorably on a smooth election and Trump returning to the White House. In his second term, Trump has vowed to pursue an agenda centered on dramatically reshaping the federal government and pursuing retribution against his perceived enemies.

The results cap a historically tumultuous and competitive election season that included two assassination attempts targeting Trump and a shift to a new Democratic nominee just a month before the party’s convention. Trump will inherit a range of challenges when he assumes office on Jan. 20, including heightened political polarization and global crises that are testing America’s influence abroad.

His win against Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, marks the second time he has defeated a female rival in a general election. Harris, the current vice president, rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race amid alarm about his advanced age. Despite an initial surge of energy around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration.

The vice president, who has not appeared publicly since the race was called, was set to speak Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, where her supporters gathered Tuesday night for a watch party while the results were still in doubt.

Trump is the first former president to return to power since Grover Cleveland regained the White House in the 1892 election. He is the first person convicted of a felony to be elected president and, at 78, is the oldest person elected to the office. His vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the highest-ranking member of the millennial generation in the U.S. government.

There will be far fewer checks on Trump when he returns to the White House. He has plans to swiftly enact a sweeping agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. His GOP critics in Congress have largely been defeated or retired. Federal courts are now filled with judges he appointed. The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, issued a ruling this year affording presidents broad immunity from prosecution.

Trump’s language and behavior during the campaign sparked growing warnings from Democrats and some Republicans about shocks to democracy that his return to power would bring. He repeatedly praised strongman leaders, warned that he would deploy the military to target political opponents he labeled the “enemy from within,” threatened to take action against news organizations for unfavorable coverage and suggested suspending the Constitution.

Some who served in his White House, including Vice President Mike Pence and John Kelly, Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, either declined to endorse him or issued dire public warnings about his return.

While Harris focused much of her initial message around themes of joy, Trump channeled a powerful sense of anger and resentment among voters.

He seized on frustrations over high prices and fears about crime and migrants who illegally entered the country on Biden’s watch. He also highlighted wars in the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to cast Democrats as presiding over – and encouraging – a world in chaos.

It was a formula Trump perfected in 2016, when he cast himself as the only person who could fix the country’s problems, often borrowing language from dictators.

“In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he said in March 2023.

This campaign often veered into the absurd, with Trump amplifying bizarre and disproven rumors that migrants were stealing and eating pet cats and dogs in an Ohio town. At one point, he kicked off a rally with a detailed story about the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer in which he praised his genitalia.

One defining moment came in July when a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump’s ear and killed a supporter. His face streaked with blood, Trump stood and raised his fist in the air, shouting “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Weeks later, a second assassination attempt was thwarted after a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through the greenery while Trump was playing golf.

Trump’s return to the White House seemed unlikely when he left Washington in early 2021 as a diminished figure whose lies about his defeat sparked a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He was so isolated then that few outside of his family bothered to attend the send-off he organized for himself at Andrews Air Force Base, complete with a 21-gun salute.

Democrats who controlled the U.S. House quickly impeached him for his role in the insurrection, making him the only president to be impeached twice. He was acquitted by the Senate, where many Republicans argued that he no longer posed a threat because he had left office.

But from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump – aided by some elected Republicans – worked to maintain his political relevance. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who then led his party in the U.S. House, visited Trump soon after he left office, essentially validating his continued role in the party.

As the 2022 midterm election approached, Trump used the power of his endorsement to assert himself as the unquestioned leader of the party. His preferred candidates almost always won their primaries, but some went on to defeat in elections that Republicans viewed as within their grasp. Those disappointing results were driven in part by a backlash to the Supreme Court ruling that revoked a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion, a decision aided by Trump-appointed justices. The midterm election prompted questions within the GOP about whether Trump should remain the party’s leader.

But if Trump’s future was in doubt, that changed in 2023 when he faced a wave of state and federal indictments for his role in the insurrection, his handling of classified information and election interference. He used the charges to portray himself as the victim of an overreaching government, an argument that resonated with a GOP base that was increasingly skeptical – if not outright hostile – to institutions and established power structures.

Special counsel Jack Smith was evaluating Wednesday how to wind down the two federal criminal cases against Trump.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican nomination, lamented that the indictments “sucked out all the oxygen” from the GOP primary. Trump easily captured his party’s nomination without participating in a debate against DeSantis or other GOP candidates.

With Trump dominating the Republican contest, a New York jury found him guilty in May of 34 felony charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. He faces sentencing this month, though his victory poses serious questions about whether he will ever face punishment.

He also has been found liable in two other New York civil cases: one for inflating his assets and another for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996.

Trump is subject to additional criminal charges in an election-interference case in Georgia that has become bogged down. On the federal level, he’s been indicted for his role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election and improperly handling classified material. When he becomes president, Trump could appoint an attorney general who would erase the federal charges.

As he prepares to return to the White House, Trump has vowed to swiftly enact a radical agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government. That includes plans to launch the largest deportation effort in the nation’s history, to use the Justice Department to punish his enemies, to dramatically expand the use of tariffs and to again pursue a zero-sum approach to foreign policy that threatens to upend longstanding foreign alliances, including the NATO pact.

When he arrived in Washington 2017, Trump knew little about the levers of federal power. His agenda was stymied by Congress and the courts, as well as senior staff members who took it upon themselves to serve as guardrails.

This time, Trump has said he would surround himself with loyalists who will enact his agenda, no questions asked, and who will arrive with hundreds of draft executive orders, legislative proposals and in-depth policy papers in hand.

In the days since the election, I’ve read thousands of words of Democratic introspection. This was the election that repudiated cancel culture, campus protests and identity politics. This was the election that transformed the debate about everything from trans people’s participation in sports to the use of niche ideological words like “Latinx.”

According to this commentary, the lesson is clear: Democratic identity politics and the Democratic Party’s move to the left cost the party working-class voters and alienated the great American middle. If Democrats want to win again, they have to shed their ideological baggage, meet American voters where they are and stop scolding them when they’re puzzled by the ever-shifting ideological demands (and language policing) of the very online left.

I agree with much of this. Cancel culture (properly defined) is toxic. White Democrats, in particular, veered to the left of Black Democrats. There has been an intense amount of intolerance in far-left spaces, and not just on campuses. There is a need for a reckoning.

But let’s be very clear about the course of this election. One candidate leaned away from the extremism of her base, and she lost.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Donald Trump’s Revenge - The New Yorker,"Electing Donald J. Trump once could be dismissed as a fluke, an aberration, a terrible mistake—a consequential one, to be sure, yet still fundamentally an error. But America has now twice elected him as its President. It is a disastrous revelation about what the United States really is, as opposed to the country that so many hoped that it could be. His victory was a worst-case scenario—that a convicted felon, a chronic liar who mismanaged a deadly once-in-a-century pandemic, who tried to overturn the last election and unleashed a violent mob on the nation’s Capitol, who calls America “a garbage can for the world,” and who threatens retribution against his political enemies could win—and yet, in the early morning hours of Wednesday, it happened.

Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris was no upset, nor was it as unimaginable as when he beat Hillary Clinton, in 2016. But it was no less shocking. For much of the country, Trump’s past offenses were simply disqualifying. Just a week ago, Harris gave her closing argument to the nation in advance of the vote. Trump “has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other—that’s who he is,” she said. “But, America, I’m here tonight to say: that’s not who we are.” Millions of voters in the states that mattered most, however, chose him anyway. In the end, Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric about invading immigrant hordes, his macho posturing against a female opponent, and his promise to boost an inflation-battered U.S. economy simply resonated more than all the lectures about his many deficiencies as a person and a would-be President.

The Lede

Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.

Eight years ago, at the dawn of what historians will call the Age of Trump in American politics, the outgoing President, Barack Obama, famously insisted that “this is not the apocalypse.” Privately, he summed up what would become the conventional view in Washington. Four years of Trump would be bad but survivable—the nation, he told a group of journalists just a few days before Trump’s Inauguration, was like a leaky boat, taking on water but hopefully still sturdy enough to stay afloat. Two terms of Trump, he warned, would be another matter entirely.

Four years later, after Joe Biden defeated Trump, Democrats and the dwindling ranks of anti-Trump Republicans made the fatal miscalculation of thinking that it was Trump who had sunk. Too many of them were sure that the hubris and folly of his reluctant exit from the Presidency had destroyed him politically. They saw him as nothing more than a sideshow—a malevolent figure in his Mar-a-Lago exile, but nonetheless a disgraced loser with no prospect of returning to power.

They were wrong. Rule No. 1 in politics is never underestimate your enemy. Trump’s enemies hungered for a reckoning, for Trump to pay a price, legally and politically, for the damage that he had wreaked on American democracy. Instead, Trump has now achieved an unthinkable resurrection. Even his four criminal indictments have served only to revive and reinvigorate his hold on the Republican Party, which is now centered more than ever on the personality and the grievances of one man. Almost sixty-three million Americans voted for Trump in 2016; more than seventy-four million cast their ballots for him in 2020. In 2024, it’s even possible, as votes are being counted overnight, that Trump might win the popular vote outright for the first time in his three races. With such backing, Trump, the first President since Grover Cleveland to be restored to the office that he lost, has vowed a second term of retribution and revenge. This time, shall we finally take him seriously?

President Biden will receive much of the blame for this catastrophic outcome—by refusing to step aside when he should have, the eighty-one-year-old President, who rationalized his entire candidacy four years ago on the existential need to keep Trump out of the Oval Office, will have contributed greatly to Trump’s return. Biden’s reckless insistence on running again despite the visible signs of his aging may well have been the 2024 campaign’s most consequential decision. When he finally bowed out, in late July, after a disastrous debate performance with Trump, was it already too late? This will be a hypothetical for the ages. Politicians from both parties make unfulfillable promises to the American electorate all the time. But the implicit premise of Biden’s candidacy might have been one of the most sadly impossible campaign pledges ever—as it turned out, there was to be no restoration of normalcy, no return to a pre-Trump America.

Harris moved swiftly and largely successfully to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket. She ran a polished if late-starting campaign during the subsequent hundred and seven days—a brief dash to Election Day more customary for a parliamentary election in Britain than for the years-long slog of endless politicking which Americans require of their candidates. But Harris, despite four years as Vice-President, had little national identity or constituency to fall back on. She was embraced by her party, thrown a rollicking, celebrity-studded Convention in Chicago, and cheered after her trouncing of Trump in their one and only debate, in September, but the net effect of her rise was to return the race to where it was before Biden’s implosion: deadlock.

In the weeks before the election, poll after poll in the seven battleground states found a contest within the margin of error. Pennsylvania and Nevada were a dead heat in the final Five Thirty Eight polling averages; Michigan and Wisconsin finished with a single-point advantage for Harris; and Arizona and Georgia showed a slight edge for Trump. Even that, in retrospect, turned out to be overly optimistic for Harris, who was losing, narrowly but decisively, in all of the battleground states at the time that the election was called. Her defeat in Pennsylvania—long considered her must-win bulwark—will probably lead to years of second-guessing her decision to bypass the state’s popular governor, Josh Shapiro, as her Vice-Presidential running mate, in favor of Tim Walz, the governor of safely Democratic Minnesota. But, given her across-the-board defeat, perhaps it would not have mattered.

Harris now becomes one of a long line of incumbent Vice-Presidents who tried and failed to secure a promotion; her difficulty in separating herself from the liabilities of Biden’s record has proved why only one sitting No. 2, George H. W. Bush, has been elected to the Presidency since Martin Van Buren did so, in 1836. Too many voters appeared to have seen Harris as effectively the incumbent President in the race—at a time when large majorities of Americans report dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. This, according to Doug Sosnik, the White House political director for President Bill Clinton, is why ten of the twelve elections leading up to this one have resulted in a change of control in the House, the Senate, and/or the White House.

Trump’s victory, in that sense, was a predictable outcome for a Republican nominee, perhaps even the expected one. And yet what a leap of unthinking partisanship and collective amnesia it has taken for his party to embrace this twice-impeached, four-times-indicted, once-convicted con man from New York. Trump in 2024 was no regular G.O.P. candidate. He was an outlier in every possible way. In 2016, perhaps it was conceivable for voters upset with the status quo to see Trump, a celebrity businessman, as the outsider who would finally shake things up in Washington. But this is the post-2020 Trump—an older, angrier, more profane Trump, who demanded that his followers embrace his big lie about the last election and whose campaign will go down as one of the most racist, sexist, and xenophobic in modern history. His slogan is now openly the stuff of strongmen—Trump alone can fix it—and he will return to office unconstrained by the establishment Republicans who challenged him on Capitol Hill and from inside his own Cabinet. Many of those figures refused to endorse Trump, including his own Vice-President, Mike Pence. Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff, the retired four-star marine general John Kelly, told the Times during the campaign that Trump met the literal definition of a “fascist,” and yet even that was not enough to deter the enablers and facilitators in the Republican Party who voted for Trump.

The new gang surrounding Trump will have few of Kelly’s qualms. He will make sure of that. One of the main lessons that Trump took from his Presidency was about the power of the staff surrounding him; his son-in-law Jared Kushner left the White House concluding that poor personnel decisions represented the biggest problem for their Administration. Soon after Trump left office, I interviewed a senior national-security official who spent extensive time with him in the Oval Office. The official warned me that a second Trump term would be far more dangerous than his first term, specifically because he had learned how better to get his way—he was, the official said, like the velociraptors in the first “Jurassic Park” movie, who proved capable of learning while hunting their prey. Already, one of Trump’s transition chairs, the billionaire Howard Lutnick, has said publicly that jobs in a new Administration will go only to those who pledge loyalty to Trump himself. Having beaten off impeachment twice, this second-term Trump will have little to fear from Congress reining him in, either, especially now that Republicans have managed to retake control of the Senate. And the Supreme Court, with its far-right majority solidified thanks to three Trump-appointed Justices, has recently granted the Presidency near-total immunity in a case brought by Trump seeking to quash the post-January 6th cases against him.

Throughout this campaign, Trump has been deliberately coy about his extreme and radical agenda for a second term. He disavowed Project 2025, the nine-hundred-page governing blueprint spearheaded by an array of his former advisers, eschewing the specifics that might have turned off voters in swing states. Trump said, for example, that he was no longer in favor of a national abortion ban, despite pledging to sign a twenty-week ban when he was in office the first time. Project 2025, if Trump were to adopt its proposals as his own, includes an extensive menu of ways to further restrict women’s access to abortion, contraception, and reproductive-health services.

But the agenda that Trump has publicly committed himself to is cause enough for grave alarm. He has said that he will begin “mass deportations” of undocumented migrants as soon as his new term begins; that he will be a dictator for a day when he is sworn in, on January 20th; that he will pardon the thousands of January 6th “hostages” who stormed the U.S. Capitol, in 2021, on his behalf; and that he will go after his opponents, the political “enemy from within,” deploying the U.S. military to quell domestic disturbances and even suggesting that Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who dared to challenge him while wearing America’s uniform, was guilty of treason and deserving of execution. It is not inconceivable that Trump will move quickly to follow through on earlier threats to fire independent officials, including two of his own appointees whom he later turned on—the F.B.I. director Christopher Wray and Jay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Even before his Inauguration, Trump’s victory will shake alliances and embolden autocrats around the world. What power will NATO’s Article 5 guarantee of mutual defense hold with an American President who has publicly said that, as far as he is concerned, Russia can do whatever it wants to NATO members who do not, in Trump’s view, pay their fair share? And what about embattled Ukraine, whose ability to fight on against Russia has been sustained by billions of dollars in U.S. military aid that Trump opposed? Trump has promised he can end the war in twenty-four hours—how will he do that, other than to pressure Ukraine to cede its stolen territory to Russia in exchange for peace on Vladimir Putin’s terms?",Donald Trump’s Revenge  The New Yorker,The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/donald-trump-wins-a-second-term
"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,We Need to Cover Donald Trump Differently This Time - Vanity Fair,"I’ve been thinking a lot about mistakes I made in my coverage of the 2024 presidential election, writing last week how, for example, I at times allowed wishcasting to cloud my judgment. The point wasn’t mere hand-wringing but to do some accountability before moving forward. This week, I’m going even further back to mistakes covering Donald Trump’s first term in hopes of doing better this time around.

Let’s start with outrage. While outrage is an understandable reaction to a lot of what Trump does and says, it’s critical to differentiate between things that are more problematic in terms of substance than style. I would find myself shocked by Trump’s vulgar remarks about women, which are of course awful, but this behavior is a feature, not a bug, of Trumpism.

The MAGA crowd loves nothing more than owning the libs, and being offended by the rank misogyny coming from Trump and his allies can distract from the GOP’s assault on abortion rights and women’s health care—because you know killing Roe wasn’t the end of it—and the broader threat to democratic institutions, which barely made it through the first go-around. There is a terrifying feeling that the center may in fact not hold, which has to be the focus right now.

Elements of Trump’s agenda, like his administration’s coming war on “wokeness,” whether in the military or education, is bafflingly vague (though one could guess it’ll lead to less diversity). The lack of specificity works to Trump’s advantage, as his supporters can read attacks on wokeness however they want. Going to war on something that’s undefined, that is more a meme or rallying cry or coded language, is an easy way to get your side excited with little downside. One Trump voter told USA Today that everyone in his community “is happy to see the woke agenda ending.” A fake war is easily won and surely Trump will declare victory over wokeness when it suits him.

But what Trump says about the “woke” wars is less consequential than what he may do under the auspices of rooting out “wokeness,” such as drafting an executive order for a “warrior board” that’s given “the power to review three- and four-star officers and to recommend removals of any deemed unfit for leadership,” as The Wall Street Journal reported. Or tapping Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host who wrote a book deriding “woke” policies in the military, to lead the Defense Department despite his lack of experience, extreme views, and a past allegation of sexual misconduct (which he denies, saying the allegation came from a consensual encounter).

It’s also important not to get too distracted by congressional hearings that appear more about racking up clips for Fox News and X than providing any meaningful government oversight. I’ve written a lot on such hearings, because they can be funny and slightly sad, but in the end, achieve little—except, perhaps, distracting from more dangerous things happening off camera. You can imagine jacketless Jim Jordan, who we saw last year leading the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, using such a perch to target any perceived enemies of Trump, including those who have tried to hold the president-elect accountable.

While Jordan, and others, make noise about “lawfare” and how Trump has been unfairly targeted by the justice system, the reality is that Trump has benefited more than anyone. Three of his Supreme Court appointees helped him derail a Justice Department trial for election subversion earlier this year by giving former presidents, such as him, broad immunity powers. Special prosecutor Jack Smith is now winding down Trump’s criminal cases as the former president (and convicted felon) can be expected to return to the White House with his most serious legal problems behind him.

The goal is to not swing at every pitch that Trump throws out. As Steve Bannon once explained to Michael Lewis, “The Democrats don’t matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” Trump is very good at this. During his last administration, there was a near-constant barrage of news. He’d tweet something that was completely insane or scary. He’d muse about buying Greenland. He’d say loving things about autocrats. But these developments can distract from the actually terrifying things Trump could accomplish in a second term. We in the media need to keep our powder dry for those eventualities, staying clear-eyed without sounding the alarms 24/7.

Will I be outraged? Obviously, Trump will do outrageous things. But in entering likely one of the most perilous moments for our democracy, we must focus on the assault on essential norms and institutions, because without them, we are lost.",We Need to Cover Donald Trump Differently This Time  Vanity Fair,Vanity Fair,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-media-second-term
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Column | The bones of America - The Washington Post,"When Donald Trump won his first election in 2016, I remember two very specific things. The first is that I left The Washington Post’s newsroom just after the race was called, at about 2:30 a.m. Halfway home, my cabdriver, an immigrant woman, turned off the radio, stopped the car and quietly vomited by the side of the road.

The second thing I remember is that, by the time I logged back onto my computer later that day, it felt as if everyone online was sharing “Good Bones,” a poem by Maggie Smith about teaching children to search for hope in broken times. “I am trying to sell them the world,” Smith writes in free verse. “Any decent realtor, walking you through a real s---hole, chirps on about good bones: This place could be beautiful, right? You could make this place beautiful.”

I loved the poem. I hated the people who were posting it just then. Not every devastation needs to be followed immediately with a vow to get up, resist, hope. Sometimes you just need to step out of the Hyundai and throw up.

This time it feels much worse. The people who voted for him this time knew exactly what they were getting and decided they wanted more.

In the end, women voted for Kamala Harris by about 10 points, according to The Post’s analysis of exit polls, but men voted for Trump by about 10 points — numbers that made the whole campaign season feel like a wash and a hideous prank. American women were voting for their lives and health care; American men were voting for ... not that. Something else. I’m too tired to list the names again of the women who have died, or almost did, because they were denied lifesaving abortions. I’m too tired to double-check, again, how many women accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct (he has denied the allegations), or to remind myself of how much money he was ordered to pay E. Jean Carroll after being found legally liable of sexual abusing her in the 1990s. He used his first rally after the polls closed to goad his supporters into calling former House speaker Nancy Pelosi a “b----.”

Does all of this mean that Harris’s game wasn’t strong enough? Late Tuesday night, this seemed to be a narrative talking heads were floating on television: She spent too much time talking about how destructive he was and not enough time talking about her own constructive plans. She didn’t talk to men enough. She didn’t speak the language of her own generation.

Or does it mean something more fundamental: that America is a Donald Trump kind of place now? That it’s not about messaging and turnout, because more people turning out will just mean more people voting for him? All kinds of people, in all kinds of counties.

Before the polls closed, I’d had a silly idea that I would go into my daughter’s room if Harris won, no matter what time it was, and whisper to her that America had elected its first female president. She wouldn’t care. She is 3 years old, and she had spent the evening asking why nobody on CNN was throwing a football because, in our house, if the television is on, it’s usually for sports. But I would know the moment was historic, and I would care, so I would tell her.

And as Trump took Pennsylvania in the 2 o’clock hour, I found myself going up to her room anyway. Kneeling by her bed, holding her hand while she slept. Thinking about how, eight hours earlier at an ice cream parlor, she had departed from chocolate ice cream for the first time to try a different flavor, mint chip, and declared it her new favorite. There are so many flavors in the world left for her to try.

Maybe tomorrow you can try a new kind of ice cream. Maybe tomorrow you can find a tree that hasn’t lost all of its leaves yet, and look at how yellow and red they are. Maybe you can get your car washed and donate to a worthy cause; maybe you can write an angry letter and also sort through your kids’ winter clothes. Tomorrow you can cry or scream in your car, but maybe you can also leave a banana muffin for your favorite co-worker. Kindness is still the best balm for psychic wounds; it helps both the giver and the recipient.

Someone on my social media feed posted last night that “despair is not an option,” but of course it is. Despair is always an option. But moving backward is not. So maybe you can do all of this and still be filled with despair, and still keep going, because if you are going to be filled with despair, you might as well also be looking for connections with other people, trying to figure out where your thread is, trying to figure out how to use it to make a stitch.

This place could be beautiful, right?

I am beginning to wonder whether that poem is not about how parents can sell hope to their children, but is a self-soothing plea from adults holding their 3-year-olds’ hands at 2 o’clock in the morning, needing something to whisper into their ears. Adults who are hoping the next generation will have tools that their generation did not.

We tried, we failed, you’re younger, you’re better.

The bulldozer is coming tomorrow to knock the place down, but maybe there’s some stuff in here that can be salvaged.

The old armoire just needs a little elbow grease; the table could last for generations if someone would just take care of it.

Maybe it could be you, when you’re older. Maybe you can show me how, too.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,What Happens to the Pending Criminal and Civil Cases Against Trump Following His Election? - Syracuse University News,"Media Tip Sheets

As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, he continues to face a barrage of legal actions against him. Syracuse University law professor Gregory Germain has been following the criminal and civil cases.

In this article, Prof. Germain summarizes the status of all of the cases and discusses what happens next. If you’d like to schedule an interview, please contact Ellen James Mbuqe, executive director of media relations at ejmbuqe@syr.edu.

Criminal Cases

Falsifying Business Records, New York Law. Trump has been convicted and is scheduled to be sentenced for a Class E felony for falsifying business records in the criminal case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and pending before Judge Juan Merchan. He faces potential prison time in the case. Election Interference, Georgia Law. Trump has been indicted in Georgia by District Attorney Fani Willis for election interference. The case has been mired in controversy following revelations that Willis had an affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee allowed Willis to continue with the prosecution if Wade resigned, which he did, but the case has been derailed by an appeal from Trump and the other defendants. Classified Documents – Federal Law. Trump has been indicted by Special Counsel Jack Smith on federal charges for stealing, retaining, and making false statements about classified documents that he took from the White House after losing the 2020 election. The case was assigned to District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, and was reversed by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals for earlier rulings improperly taking jurisdiction and appointing a special master during the investigation of the document theft. Judge Cannon dismissed the charges against Trump on a technicality, by finding that Jack Smith’s appointment under the Department of Justice’s special counsel regulation, and the regulation itself, violated the appointments clause of the Constitution. Cannon did not give the government an opportunity to remedy the election clause deficiency, such as by appointing a Senate approved United States Attorney to supervise the case. Cannon’s decision is on appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Election Interference – Federal Law. Trump has been indicted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for election interference in the 2020 election. The case was delayed because of controversy concerning the standard for presidential immunity. The trial court and the D.C. Circuit ruled that a former president has no immunity for crimes committed while in office. The Supreme Court reversed that in Trump v. United States, ruling that a president has broad immunity for actions taken even in bad faith and for personal gain broadly connected with his official duties. Prosecutor Jack Smith has attempted to limit the indictment to address the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, but serious immunity questions remain. The case is pending before Judge Tanja Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee.

Civil Cases

Defamation – New York Law. E. Jean Carroll recovered an $83,300,000 civil judgment against Trump in Manhattan for defamation. Carroll claimed that Donald Trump sexually attacked her in a department store in the 1990s, and claimed that Trump’s denials and attacks constituted defamation. Trump posted a bond and obtained a stay pending appeal, and the case is on appeal. Financial Statement Fraud – New York Law. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who campaigned for election on promises to “get Trump,” brought civil claims against Trump for disgorgement of gains realized by using an inflated personal financial statement used when seeking insurance policies and obtaining secured claims for his subsidiary corporations from sophisticated lenders. State court judge Arthur F. Engoron awarded the Attorney General $363,800,000 in damages, which now amounts to over $450,000,000 with interest. The court also barred Trump and other executives from being officers of a New York corporation, and appointed a receiver to liquidate Trump’s company. The Court of Appeals granted a special stay pending appeal upon the posting of a reduced $175,000,000 bond. The liberal 1st Department Appellate Division raised questions about the propriety of the judgment.

There seems little doubt that the federal cases brought by Jack Smith will be terminated. Gregory Germain

What happens to the Criminal Cases?

The Department of Justice has issued two detailed memorandum opinions, one in 1973 and another in 2000, discussing a sitting president’s scope of immunity from criminal and civil actions. In both opinions, the Department determined that a sitting president cannot be indicted, prosecuted or jailed for a criminal claim while in office. The Department based both decisions on the principles of separation of powers – holding that the indictment, prosecution or jailing of a sitting president would allow one branch of government (the judiciary) to interfere with another branch of government (the executive). No other executive officers (including the Vice President – a matter of contemporaneous concern for Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1973) would enjoy such immunity. The opinions apply equally to federal and state prosecutions.

So it’s clear that the federal prosecutions brought by Jack Smith will not continue, even if Trump did not pardon himself or cause Smith to be removed from office and replaced with a loyal alternative. And there is every indication from Trump that he will attempt to remove Smith or accept his resignation, or more likely will pardon himself. While the Department has another opinion rejecting the President’s power to self-pardon, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling stated that a President’s pardon power is unlimited – even suggesting that the corrupt sale of pardons would not affect the validity of the pardons. So I have no doubt that the Supreme Court majority would uphold a self-pardon. So there seems little doubt that the federal cases brought by Jack Smith will be terminated.

The President’s pardon power does not extend to state prosecutions. However, the Justice Department’s separation of powers rulings apply to all criminal prosecutions, state and federal. Under the Justice Department’s opinion, it seems clear that the state criminal prosecutions must be stayed while President Trump is in office. There is even an argument under those opinions that the cases must be dismissed, because the opinions held that an indictment of a sitting president that was stayed from further prosecution while in office would interfere with the functioning of the presidency. The same could be argued for a stayed sentence. I also have no doubt that the current Supreme Court would agree with the separation of powers arguments made in the Justice Department’s rulings. In its immunity decision, the Supreme Court adopted the broadest possible view of presidential immunity, and even the dissenting justices expressed concern about politically-based state prosecutions interfering with the functioning of the president. So in all likelihood, the state criminal cases will be put on hold during Trump’s presidency. If they try to continue with the prosecutions, or even to impose a stayed sentence, I suspect the decisions will be reversed on appeal. It is even possible that the cases will be dismissed.

What Happens to the Civil Cases?

The continuation of the civil cases is far more uncertain. There are two important civil precedents from the Supreme Court: Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), and Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997). In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Court recognized that the sitting president is broadly immune from liability in civil actions for official conduct, both while in office or afterward. The case has limited applicability to the three civil actions discussed above, because all of the alleged acts (defamation, falsifying business records, and inflating financial statement) had nothing to do with his official acts, not did the acts occur primarily while he was in office.

The second case, Clinton v Jones, involved civil charges by Paula Jones for alleged misconduct before Clinton was in office and completely unrelated to his official duties. The Supreme Court held that the civil charges could continue, but that the court would have to make special arrangements from the president’s participation in the action so as not to interfere with the performance of his presidential duties, suggesting that any depositions would have to be taken in the White House, and that the president could not be compelled to testify live). So the Clinton case suggests that the appeals in the civil cases can continue, because they are unlikely to require President Trump’s personal participation. If, as I think likely because of legal errors and excessive awards, the civil cases are reversed on appeal and remanded for new trials, the courts on remand would have to be very careful to conduct a fair trial without interfering with the president’s official functions.

If the election shows anything, it shows that the public does not like politically motivated prosecutions and impeachments. Gregory Germain

Thoughts on the Future of Politically Motivated Prosecutions

The Democratic Party and its politically motivated government prosecutors also need to reconsider their actions. If the election shows anything, it shows that the public does not like politically motivated prosecutions and impeachments. The argument that Trump was a convicted felon backfired, as the public saw him as a victim of biased and politically motivated prosecutions brought in Democratic strongholds. Now the ball is in Trump’s court to see if he will carry through on his threats to “do unto others as they did unto him.” If he does carry through on his threats, I suspect his support will quickly fade.",What Happens to the Pending Criminal and Civil Cases Against Trump Following His Election?

"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,"Donald Trump isn’t a Christian, and that’s OK. - Calvin University Chimes","The Church should reevaluate its expectation that political leaders, particularly the President, share our faith. Such a reevaluation should also prompt us to rethink our politics. The collapse of Christendom (the time when the Church ruled over the West) makes possible for the Church a choice between two different politics: a democratic politics, and a politics shaped by the cross. In the ruins of Christendom we can now live lives in the knowledge that Christ rules the world, and we do not.

He’s not a Christian…

Donald Trump is not a Christian. Marcail Schuurmann, who argued last week that Trump fails to represent Christian values, will, I’m sure, be glad to know this. This might come as a surprise to some readers, who have seen our president-elect interact with high-profile Christians, heard him state that God saved his life during an assassination attempt in Butler, PA, and stand with a raised Bible in hand outside of St. John’s Church in Washington DC during the unrest of the summer of 2020. Like most politicians in the U.S., Trump has done his due diligence in expressing his faith. Although they are not exactly churchgoing, the American electorate is still suspicious of a politician who isn’t even willing to put in an attempt.

And so, though Donald Trump has done what is required to present himself as one, I do not think he is a Christian. In the ruins of Christendom, the Church can no longer assume that what it looks like to be an American is what it looks like to be a Christian. This means that we will become distinctive, or we will disappear. These distinctions might look like the practices of table fellowship, confession of sin, submission to the discipline of a church body, and the hearing of the Word preached consistently. While I do not know him, I do not think Donald Trump engages in these practices.

…and that’s OK.

In saying that it is OK that Donald Trump is not a Christian I am no longer addressing the argument in Mar’s essay last week. Mar claimed that Donald Trump does not represent Christian values but made no claim as to the value of this fact. However, these kinds of claims are often embedded in some Christian’s rhetoric about democratic politics. They say, ‘This politician supports this/acts like this. Jesus would not support that/act like that. Thus I cannot support this politician, nor condone them acting like that.’ I think we should stop talking like this. Furthermore, I think Jesus died so that we could stop talking like this.

When I say it’s OK that Donald Trump isn’t a Christian, I use ‘OK’ to mean neither good nor bad. I do not feel strongly either way about Donald Trump not being a Christian, and you (as a member of the Church) should not either. It is of course not very good that Donald Trump is not a Christian — the State of the Union would be a wonderful time for one of us to preach. But it is also not very bad. There are many people in America who are not Christians — people who are easier to get to and who need Jesus a little more than a billionaire might. But beyond good or bad, I mostly believe that the president-elect not being a Christian is OK because it is a reality that the Church will have to get used to.

I do not think it will be long until we have a President who is not even willing to do their due diligence, who refuses to placate the evangelical bloc with photo-ops using the Bible as a prop. What will we do then? Should we remake the Moral Majority and try to throw our weight around Washington? Do we want to become another interest group that clamors to be included in high-powered meetings? That is a well-worn path, one that the Church should decisively turn away from.

Withdrawal?

To some the claim that the Church will have to get used to a president who does not belong to the Church may sound like a call to withdraw from democratic politics. Those people might say, ‘We cannot withdraw, we must engage. Christians have a stake in the character and values of the President. We should vote for one who represents our values and vote against one who does not. As Christians, we must participate in democratic politics by agitating against and exhorting those politicians who do not share our values.’ I do not think this is how a Christian should speak, act or think politically. Stated strongly, withdrawing from a politics so described is a prerequisite to the participation in a truer politics, a politics only available to the Church: a politics shaped by the cross.

The politics of the cross.

Politics is a morally formative enterprise. The systems of building and keeping power that we engage in shape our hearts, whether or not we know of and assent to that shaping. In recognizing that politics is a morally formative enterprise, we can begin to see how watching cable news all day or doom scrolling through political social media feeds stands in opposition to the communion fellowship of the Church. Our consumption of political media shapes us towards a life lived in the ecstasy and fear of democratic politics. American theologian Stanley Hauerwas, in a sermon to Duke Divinity School on election day in 2016, reminds us that “there is a democratic moment in the Gospels. They chose Barabbas.”

The politics of the Church are incomprehensible to democratic politics. They are not practiced through the expression of our power, but in the remembrance of one who gave up His power, humbling himself “even unto death on a cross.” Our consumption of Christ’s body and blood witnesses to, and shapes us towards, a life lived in the freedom of a cross that raised for us a new and eternal King.","Donald Trump isn’t a Christian, and that’s OK.

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans’ views of Donald Trump, his conduct since the election and their feelings about the country. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,609 U.S. adults from November 12 to 17, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. In addition, this survey is also weighted to benchmarks for voter turnout and presidential vote preference. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.

Following Donald Trump’s victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election, Americans narrowly approve of the president-elect’s plans and policies for the future. Roughly half of U.S. adults (53%) approve of his plans, while 46% disapprove.

As was the case during the presidential campaign, Trump draws broad confidence for his handling of the economy. Nearly six-in-ten Americans (59%) say they are very or somewhat confident in the president-elect to make good decisions about economic policy.

Majorities also express confidence in Trump on law enforcement and criminal justice (54%), immigration (53%) and foreign policy (53%), while fewer (45%) are confident in Trump’s handling of abortion policy.

Jump to Chapter 1 for more on Americans’ views of Trump

Following a divisive presidential contest, 41% are confident in Trump to bring the country closer together; 59% express little or no confidence that Trump can do this. And Americans give Trump low marks for his efforts to date to reach out to those who supported Kamala Harris in the election.

Roughly half of Americans (52%) say it is extremely or very important for Trump to reach out to Harris’ supporters to try to unify the country. Another 30% say this is somewhat important. Only 17% say this is not too or not at all important.

Just 31% of Americans say Trump has done an excellent or good job reaching out to the vice president’s supporters to try to bring the country together; more than twice as many (66%) say he has done only a fair or poor job.

Jump to Chapter 2 for more on expectations of the transition and Trump’s conduct

The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted among 9,609 adults from Nov. 12 to 17, 2024, finds that Trump’s personal image is more positive than it was shortly after the 2020 or 2016 elections.

(Note: Most interviews were completed before Trump announced several of his nominees for Cabinet positions, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, and his initial selection of Matt Gaetz for attorney general)

When asked to indicate their feelings toward Trump on a “feeling thermometer” ranging from 0 to 100, 43% give Trump a “very warm” or “warm” rating (between 51 and 100 on the 0-100 scale). Somewhat more (48%) give Trump a “cold” rating (below 50), including 40% who rate him “very cold” (between 0 and 24).

Still, the share of Americans rating Trump warmly today (43%) is higher than it was after the 2020 (34%) or the 2016 (36%) elections.

Fewer than four-in-ten describe Trump as even-tempered and a good role model. In evaluating Trump’s personal traits and characteristics, a 55% majority say the phrase “mentally sharp” describes Trump very or fairly well, while nearly as many (51%) say he keeps his promises.

Fewer than half describe the president-elect as caring about the needs of ordinary Americans (45%) or honest (42%).

And as was the case during the presidential campaign, Trump draws relatively low ratings for being even-tempered (37%) and a good role model (34%).

How Americans feel about the country after the election

The share of Americans who are satisfied with the way things are going in the country has increased since October, from 23% to 29%. As has been the case for the past several years, a large majority (70%) remains dissatisfied with national conditions.

Jump to Chapter 3 for more on Americans’ feelings about the state of the nation

Republicans and Democrats have traded places in their views of the country since Trump’s victory:

35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents express positive views of national conditions, up from just 10% last month.

About a quarter of Democrats and Democratic leaners (24%) have positive views, compared with 38% in October.

Fear and anger are dominant emotions among Democrats. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats (73%) say they are “fearful” about the state of the country, while 54% say they feel “angry.” Just 29% of Democrats feel “hopeful” and even fewer (14%) feel “proud.”

Republicans are more hopeful, less fearful. Most Republicans (76%) say they feel hopeful about the state of the country, while nearly half (46%) say they are proud. Fear and anger are less widespread among Republicans than Democrats.

Related: After Trump’s victory, Democrats are more pessimistic about their party’s future

Other findings: Presidential transition, emotional reactions to Trump’s win, the state of partisan relations

Smooth presidential transition anticipated, in contrast with 2020. A sizable majority of Americans (70%) say they are very or somewhat confident that the transition to the Trump administration will go smoothly. Republicans (79%) are more likely than Democrats (64%) to say the transition will go well. At a similar point four years ago, when Trump was contesting the election results, just 26% expected the transition to go smoothly.

Trump’s post-election conduct viewed much more positively than four years ago. Shortly after the 2020 election, only about a quarter of Americans (28%) viewed Trump’s post-election conduct as excellent or good. Today, nearly twice as many (53%) view his conduct positively. A comparable share (56%) rate Harris’ post-election conduct as excellent or good.

Reactions to Trump’s victory. Republicans are reacting to the election results with a mixture of relief (46% say they are relieved by Trump’s victory) and excitement (43%). A majority of Democrats (56%) express disappointment at the outcome, while 31% say they are angry. For the most part, reactions to Trump’s victory are comparable to his election win in 2016.

Just 14% expect partisan relations to improve. Most Americans expect relations between Republicans and Democrats in Washington to get worse (45%) or stay about the same (41%) in the coming year. In post-election surveys over the past decade, no more than about one-in-five (21% in 2020) have predicted improvement in partisan relations.",Public Narrowly Approves of Trump’s Plans; Most Are Skeptical He Will Unify the Country  Pew Research Center,Pew Research Center,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/11/22/public-narrowly-approves-of-trumps-plans-most-are-skeptical-he-will-unify-the-country/
"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,We can rage about Donald Trump. Or we can be curious about why he appealed to so many - The Guardian,"How can anyone vote for someone so… fill in the blank… racist, sexist, unconstitutional, hateful, unhinged? This is the question asked frequently in the UK and here in the States, where I have spent the past three weeks trying to understand the Trump phenomenon.

Behind the question is an implied superiority; that we, the clever people, have identified the monster that is Donald Trump, but the deluded masses are too stupid to see it. But what I have found at the Trump rallies I’ve been to is not stupidity, but frustration, pain and a longing for respect.

Tucker Carlson at Madison Square Garden captured this sentiment with his usual swagger. “They tell you, the people who can actually change a flat tyre, who pay your taxes and work 40 hours a week, that you are somehow immoral. We have a message for them: you are not better than us, you are not smarter than us.”

To dismiss this as the politics of grievance is to dismiss what it feels like to be disrespected, to feel “a stranger in your own land”. To feel as though the college-educated are looking down at the non-college-educated.

Even now, after his overwhelming victory, many still fume that Trump has returned to power on the back of a pack of lies, sometimes very big lies (like he won the 2020 election). And of course that’s part of the story. But his supporters have some justification for believing that his win has in fact been forged from a powerful truth. The economy is not being run in their interests, government is not working for them, and mainstream political parties have not been up to the job in recent years.

This is what appealed to so many people including lifelong Democrats such as Bill, who was the first person I chatted to at a rally in Latrobe, just outside Pittsburgh. “I was a Democrat all my life, a local organiser. I was invited to a fundraiser, bought a new suit to look smart, turned up and listened to all the speeches. By the end of the evening, there had been a programme aimed at everyone – those on benefits, single mothers, new immigrants – but nothing of any kind at me, a dad of two children, trying to pay the mortgage, working hard to get on. I realised the Democrats were no longer for me.”

What motivated so many of them was a lack of order and control in their lives

Yes, there was a cultish feel to the mass of red Maga hats and rhythmic chants of USA, USA, and yes, a full buffet of conspiracy theories was often on the menu. But what motivated so many of them was a lack of order and control in their lives. If you don’t know who is coming across the border, you feel uneasy and at risk. If you can’t predict how much your groceries will cost week to week, you feel the pressure.

And to solve this? You need a disruptor. Someone who doesn’t go along with the stale, failed, norms of political discourse, someone from outside politics who can hack through the undergrowth even if in doing so he might offend. If Trump was polite, generous, restrained and conciliatory, his supporters would find it impossible to believe he would give the system the good shake they believe it needs.

So, Trump’s appeal is there in plain sight. It is not an aberration. It is not inexplicable. And now we know for certain, it’s not going away. The truth is the Democrats lost people – head and heart. They failed at being good technocrats (the head) with high inflation and open borders. And failed at telling a story in which struggling working families could feel seen and heard (the heart).

This is now the challenge for the Democrats in the US fighting to win back power, and Labour in the UK trying to make a success of their victory. Trump’s win could be a moment, like Margaret Thatcher’s victory in 1979, where the old rules of politics are turned on their head and where the buildings blocks of a new progressive project need to be rebuilt from first principles.

The outlines of what needs to happen will emerge. A project that is squarely back on the side of working people. Where we do the “heavy lifting” to get better and bolder policies on the cost of living, making work pay, securing our borders, providing for the aspirations of those who don’t go to university.

Where we understand that the way we govern is not working for too many people and needs to change fundamentally if we are to rebuild trust. Where we get to grips with a diffuse and polarised media and communicate far more cleverly. And where we tell a story about the common good, of belonging and respect, that is sufficiently hard-headed to bring people together.

Trump won because he was the better candidate with a better message. I believe both his policies and approach will not in the end work, and will probably do a lot of damage on the way. But to millions, whether we admit it or not, he offered real hope – of greater prosperity, more security and fewer wars. Many looked to him as a protector – from a world of change and from patronising elites.

We now have a choice: rage at Trump supporters – or curiosity. We can spend the coming months in fruitless intellectual contortions about whether he meets the criteria for being a fascist, or we can properly understand what has just happened and get to work deepening, widening and improving a new progressive agenda with the vim and vitality to mount a serious fightback.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results - Brookings Institution,"Trump won a personal victory in the 2024 election, sweeping all the swing states, improving his vote share just about everywhere, and—unlike his 2016 victory—garnering an outright majority of the popular vote. In addition, he led the Republican Party to a larger-than-expected Senate majority and, although many House races remain to be called, an expanded House majority may result as well. These gains are more than incremental; indeed, they may signal a new era in American politics.

Political scientists and historians will spend years analyzing the causes and significance of this election. My focus is more immediate. Although the data are imperfect and incomplete, I will offer preliminary answers to two questions, which are really two sides of the same coin: Why did Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election, and why did Kamala Harris lose?

Trump’s victory

Donald Trump’s theory of the case was broadly correct. He and his campaign managers believed that it was possible to build on Republicans’ growing strength among white working-class voters to create a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. He was right: If the exit polls turn out to be accurate, he made strides among Latinos and African Americans, especially men. He increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% to 20% and carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%.

The Trump campaign also believed that they could improve their performance among young adults, and they did—from 35% in 2020 to 42% this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of this gain reflected a shift toward Trump among young men. Trump spent lots of time on podcasts, such as Joe Rogan’s, whose principal audiences are this otherwise hard-to-reach group.

After the Republican primaries, the victorious Trump forces faced a choice: They could moderate their message to reach out to disappointed backers of Nikki Haley, who ran a traditional Reagan conservative campaign, or they could continue their all-out appeal to the Republican base while enjoying the grudging support of his defeated adversary. They chose the latter course and won the gamble that the party would unite around them. Donald Trump received 94% of the Republican vote and as a bonus, reduced the Democratic edge among Independents from nine points in 2020 to five points this year.

The Trump campaign’s tactical choices paid off. Three turned out to be critical. First: Convinced that Trump’s intense personal bond with his supporters would do most of the mobilizing work, the campaign decided not to invest heavily in traditional get-out-the-vote organizing and instead outsourced it to supporting organizations. Although the Harris campaign touted its advantage in the “ground game,” there is little evidence that it made much of a difference.

Second: The Trump campaign decided that Harris’ stance on transgender issues was the Willie Horton of 2024 and invested heavily in negative advertising that dominated the airwaves throughout the South.1 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this campaign helped weaken Harris’ effort to portray herself as a common-sense center-left candidate rather than an emissary from San Francisco.

Third: Donald Trump chose to modulate his stance on abortion by declaring early on that each state should decide this matter for itself and then doubling down by vowing to veto a national abortion ban. Many longtime foes of abortion were disappointed, and some were outraged. Nevertheless, Trump paid no price, winning 81% of the white evangelical vote—virtually unchanged from four years ago.

Harris’ defeat

The Harris campaign was always running uphill. She served as vice president to a president whose approval rating plunged in the middle of his first year in office and never recovered. The public’s judgment of his performance on two core issues—inflation and immigration—was harshly negative, and Harris inherited this disapproval when Joe Biden abandoned his quest for a second term.

The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president’s tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters. She did the best she could in the circumstances by quickly unifying the party and building on Biden’s campaign apparatus rather than starting from scratch, but she never entirely overcame the difficulties stemming from Biden’s timetable.

Harris’ theory of the case was flawed. Looking at examples from the 2022 elections, she assumed that putting reproductive rights at the center of her agenda would mobilize an army of angry women and move them to the polls in record numbers. This did not happen. Women’s share of the total vote rose only marginally from its level in 2020, and Harris’ share of the women who voted did not increase from Biden’s 2020 levels. It is hard to judge how much this emphasis on abortion contributed to Harris’ poor showing among men—just 43%, down from Biden’s 48% in 2020—but it did nothing to convince them that a Harris administration would be sensitive to their concerns.

Her closing argument—that Donald Trump posed a clear and present danger to democracy—fared little better. This happened in part because many Republicans and Independents saw Harris and the Democrats as the real threats to democracy, and also because the charge offered no new information that would sway voters whose minds weren’t made up. Donald Trump may be the best-known candidate in modern American history, making it difficult to change anyone’s view of him.

Harris’ tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden’s unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters. Similarly, by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public’s perception of her and opened the door to the Trump campaign’s charge that she was a closet radical. Thinking back to the successful campaign of Bill Clinton in 1992, some Democrats were hoping Harris would have a “Sister Souljah” moment in which she broke with some party orthodoxy in order to show her independence, but this did not happen.

Second, Harris’ decision to avoid media interviews during the first half of her campaign created the impression that she was dependent on scripted remarks and afraid to think on her feet. Answering tough questions can enhance a candidate’s reputation for competence and character, a potential upside to which Harris and her campaign seemed oblivious for much too long.

Conclusion

Democrats knew that the election would be close, but the scope of their defeat will likely trigger recriminations first and then an extended period of soul-searching. As was the case after Michael Dukakis’ defeat in 1988, the party will be forced to engage in a debate about the causes of its defeat, and what is sure to be a long and lively primary campaign will determine the path forward.

Meanwhile, President Trump will be challenged to honor the sweeping promises he made during his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can impose massive tariffs without raising costs for average families and triggering another round of inflation. Also uncertain is whether he can quell conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as he claims while reducing America’s global commitments. And it is possible that trying to deport millions of immigrants present in the U.S. could blow up in his face by creating civil strife and a backlash among Latino voters who have rallied to this cause. If he fails to meet the hopes that he has aroused, especially in the new supporters who provided his majority, he and his party may pay a price in 2026 and beyond.",Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results  Brookings Institution,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,President-elect Donald Trump’s healthcare agenda - PwC,"President-elect Donald Trump is expected to maintain his strong stance on deregulation and prioritize policies that address healthcare access and costs. Looking ahead, the Trump administration intends to uphold campaign promises for the health sector with four key themes:

Promote access to healthcare via market competition and transparency

Enhance flexibility and choice in healthcare to states and individuals

Focus on deregulation by reversing or modifying Biden-era policies

Enhance national security with “America first” principles

President-elect Trump’s second term marks a significant shift in the political landscape that could have considerable implications for the health industry. It is important to consider how the landscape has changed since President-elect Trump’s first administration. For example, efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) no longer retain the level of political or public support they did in 2016. Instead, recent comments from President-elect Trump have suggested he takes credit for “saving” the ACA; this may indicate more focus on technical fixes across the sector rather than sweeping reforms.

The new Trump administration will also need to navigate working with a Republican party with significant intraparty tensions between traditional, establishment Republicans and the more populist Republicans who are increasingly skeptical of the traditional Republican platform regarding pro-business, small government ideology. For example, despite the traditional GOP stance against government interventionalist policies, President-elect Trump has vowed to “take on big pharma” and to address perceived anticompetitive activity. Likewise, Vice-President elect J.D. Vance has expressed support for FTC Commissioner Lina Khan as recently as August 2024 and remains a supporter of mandates such as a $35 cap on insulin across commercial plans. Indeed, this presents a paradox; while the campaign has emphasized deregulatory priorities throughout the election, the administration’s policies may stray further from the traditional GOP approach than in past years.

As many organizations continue scenario planning for the impact of the election, a wide breadth of possibilities exist. On one end, policy shifts can move at a snail's pace with seemingly dramatic proposals tamed over the course of debate, judicial proceedings and ultimate implementation. On the other end, however, lies the nexus of a right-leaning Supreme Court, a White House with fewer GOP traditionalists influencing decisions and a set of broad reaching, dynamic proposals. Debates within the Republican party also introduce an additional layer of uncertainty given prominent agendas that either embrace a disbelief in government (and interest in deconstructing its core foundations) or an interest in leveraging the entirety of governmental power towards a more populist agenda.

One indicator to forecast headwinds will be the selection of agency leadership and policy advisors, including those not subject to Senate confirmation. Nonconventional backgrounds, experiences and priorities that the appointees bring with them to the executive branch may signal the potential degree of disruption or uncertainty. Equally indicative of impact will be the length of time each appointee remains in their position as short tenures will limit ability to implement significant changes or create influence.



Monitoring events closely and modifying scenario planning accordingly can help organizations prepare for shifts as the Trump administration seeks to fulfill campaign promises, continue unfinished business from the president-elect's previous term and potentially set the trajectory of the Republican party for the future.",President-elect Donald Trump’s healthcare agenda  PwC,PwC,https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/election-2024-trump-health-agenda.html

You can do so using the player above or on the NYT Audio App, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.

You’ve probably seen the clip by now. Donald Trump is holding a town hall. It’s Monday, Oct. 14, in Pennsylvania. He was being asked softball questions by Kristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota, and there is a medical emergency in the crowd. The rally stops for a while. They play “Ave Maria” while the medics respond. Then Trump and Noem begin again. Then someone else in the crowd needs medical help. The rally stops again, begins again. Noem is settling back in when Trump announces he’s had enough.

Donald Trump: Let’s not do any more questions. Let’s just listen to music. Let’s make it into a music. [Cheers.] Who the hell wants to hear questions, right? [Laughter.]

What comes next is something I’ve never seen before. Trump, swaying dreamily to his playlist, in front of a rally full of people, for nearly 40 minutes. It was like he was D.J.’ing his own bar mitzvah. You can look, in these clips, at the faces of the people around him, like Noem. They really have no idea what to do. They are suddenly backup dancers in a concert that shouldn’t exist.

Part of me finds Donald Trump’s behavior here unusually relatable. You think I want to sit up here talking about politics and war day after day? You don’t know the temptation to, just once, just for one week, turn this podcast into a drum and bass set or play you my favorite Kiasmos songs. But I don’t. Of course I don’t. It’s not what we’re doing here. And if I were a presidential candidate in the final weeks of a campaign, I wouldn’t do what Trump did, because the fallout would be predictable: an avalanche of media coverage asking, “What the hell was that?”

I wouldn’t do it because of the inevitable attacks from my opponents about the strange behavior I’d just exhibited onstage.

Tim Walz: I would not usually encourage you, but we’re doing it now. Go watch this guy right now. And go watch these rallies or this town hall. He stopped taking questions and stood frozen onstage for 30 minutes while they played his Spotify list for people. [Laughter.] It was strange. But if this was your grandfather, you would take the keys away. You would take the keys away.

I don’t think Walz has this right. Trump did not freeze up on that stage; I’m not going to accept that. He did not lose where he was in the moment. If anything, he was all too present.

"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,What Trump supporters believe and expect - Pew Research Center,"People in New York City watch on a screen as Donald Trump addresses his supporters while votes are counted on Nov. 6, 2024. (Fatih Aktas/Anadolu via Getty Images)

With Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election, he is poised to make sweeping policy changes at home and abroad. What do the voters in Trump’s coalition want? How do they view the country and its challenges? Here’s what we know from Pew Research Center’s preelection surveys over the past year.

Supporters saw Trump as a change candidate. In an October survey, most of his supporters (86%) said he would change Washington for the better, while only 12% said he wouldn’t change things much. Supporters of Kamala Harris saw Trump as likely to change things, too, but 92% said he would change things for the worse.

How we did this This Pew Research Center analysis focuses on the perceptions and attitudes of Donald Trump’s supporters in the months leading up to his election on Nov. 5. All of the data in this analysis comes from Center surveys conducted over the course of 2024 presidential campaign. Links to these reports, including details about the survey methodology, are available in the text.

The economy and immigration were top issues for Trump supporters. Just as it was in 2020, the economy was the most important issue for Trump voters this year. In a September survey, 93% said it was very important to their vote.

Immigration ranked second, as 82% said it was very important to their vote. This was a substantial increase from 2020, when 61% of Trump supporters rated it as very important to them.

Issues that were much less important to Trump voters included climate change (11% said it was very important), racial and ethnic inequality (18%), and abortion (35%).

Trump supporters were unified on several cultural issues in polling conducted over the course of the year. Among those that they generally agreed on:

92% believed that biological sex is not mutable. Just 7% said a person can be a man or woman even if that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth.

89% said gun ownership does more to increase than decrease safety.

83% viewed the criminal justice system as not tough enough on criminals.

75% did not think the legacy of slavery affects the position of Black people in American society today much or at all.

On each of these issues, majorities of Harris supporters expressed opposing views.

There were two areas where Trump backers’ positions might challenge conventional wisdom:

Asked whether the gains women have made in society have come at the expense of men, most (71%) said no.

And just over half – 55% – said religion should be kept separate from government policies, although that is roughly 30 percentage points lower than the share of Harris supporters who said the same.

Trump supporters wanted a smaller government but no changes to Social Security. Republicans and Democrats have long differed over the size and scope of government, and that continued in this election cycle. For example, 72% of Trump supporters said aid to the poor does more harm than good. Only 18% of Harris backers said the same.

However, large majorities of Trump (77%) and Harris supporters (83%) opposed any reductions in the Social Security program.

Trump supporters had especially negative views of national conditions. A month before the election, only 5% of Trump supporters said they were satisfied with the way things were going in the country. And in September, roughly nine-in-ten (89%) said they were very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods.

Harris supporters were also broadly dissatisfied, but less so. Four-in-ten were satisfied with the way things were going, and 62% were very concerned about prices.

Economic pessimism was evident in many countries this year. As in the U.S., negative assessments of the economy were typically much higher among members of the party not in power than among supporters of the party in control of government.

Trump supporters felt they understood his policy positions ahead of the election. In October, more than nine-in-ten Trump supporters (94%) said he had clearly explained his policies for addressing illegal immigration. Large majorities said the same about his policies on the economy and foreign policy. The one topic that lagged a bit was health care: 58% said they knew what he would do if he won the race.

Trump supporters saw Harris’ positions on several issues, including immigration and the economy, as less clear than Trump’s.

What’s acceptable – and unacceptable – on day one? What do Trump’s supporters think of some of the more unprecedented steps he has suggested he may take in his early days in office? In the September survey:

58% of Trump supporters said it would be definitely or probably acceptable for him to use executive orders to make policies if he can’t get his priorities through Congress.

54% said it would be acceptable for him to order federal law enforcement officials to investigate his Democratic political opponents.

At the same time, 58% said it would be unacceptable for him to fire government workers for not being loyal to him.

57% said it would be unacceptable for him to pardon friends or supporters who have been convicted of a crime.

Is there an olive branch? In October, 86% of Trump supporters said he should focus on addressing the concerns of all Americans, not just his supporters, if he were elected – even if that meant disappointing some of those who had backed him.

In September, seven-in-ten Trump supporters said the next president should work with the opposing party in Congress. In October, an identical share of Trump backers saw this as very or somewhat likely if Trump won, though just 19% said it would be very likely.",What Trump supporters believe and expect  Pew Research Center,Pew Research Center,https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/13/what-trump-supporters-believe-and-expect/
"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Matt Gaetz: Trump's choice for attorney general shocks Washington - BBC.com,"Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message

Key moments from loyal Trump supporter Matt Gaetz

Donald Trump’s nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.

Of all the president-elect’s picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.

The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.

Trump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defence secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.

But it is Gaetz making most headlines. The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year. But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.

In 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.

His bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. And so Trump's choice of Gaetz for this crucial role is a signal to those Republicans, too - his second administration will be staffed by loyalists who he trusts to enact his agenda, conventional political opinion be damned.

Gasps were heard during a meeting of Republican lawmakers when the nomination for America's top US prosecutor was announced, Axios reported, citing sources in the room.

Republican congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho reportedly responded with an expletive.

“I don't think it's a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said. “This one was not on my bingo card.”

Gaetz does have some allies on Capitol Hill who share an unwavering loyalty to Trump. The Florida lawmaker has been one of the president-elect's most aggressive and relentless defenders - at congressional hearings, in press conferences and during television appearances.

On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an ""accomplished attorney"".

""He's a reformer in his mind and heart, and I think that he'll bring a lot to the table on that,"" said Johnson.

In a social media post, Trump spelled out how he intends to use Gaetz as a wrecking ball to radically change the US Department of Justice, which he has regularly blamed for his multiple legal troubles.

“Matt will root out the systemic corruption at the DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution,” he wrote.

During the campaign, Trump promised retribution for the numerous investigations launched against him. Now, it appears, Gaetz will be at the frontlines of Trump’s efforts to bring the justice department to heel.

The department also investigated Gaetz himself.

Last year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.

He was the subject of an ongoing ethics investigation in the House of Representatives into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and misuse of campaign funds.",Matt Gaetz: Trump's choice for attorney general shocks Washington  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2k0472q8v0o
"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here’s what he’s proposed - The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.

The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America’s international role.

Trump’s agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.

A look at what Trump has proposed:

Immigration

“Build the wall!” from his 2016 campaign has become creating “the largest mass deportation program in history.” Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He’s pitched “ideological screening” for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he’d reinstitute first-term policies such as “Remain in Mexico,” limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.

Abortion

Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman’s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump’s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk — a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

But it’s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug as well as the agency’s relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden’s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.

Taxes

Trump’s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That’s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden’s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.

Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It’s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income — a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.

Tariffs and trade

Trump’s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy “essential” medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of “any vital infrastructure” in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.

DEI, LGBTQ and civil rights

Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.

On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end “boys in girls’ sports,” a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration’s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.

Regulation, federal bureaucracy and presidential power

The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households’ utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration — even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations — though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end “frivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.”

The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.

He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government’s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.

Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers’ budget actions “set a ceiling” on spending but not a floor — meaning the president’s constitutional duty to “faithfully execute the laws” includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.

As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.

Education

The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding “for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”

In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his “secret weapon” against the “Marxist Maniacs and lunatics” he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect “billions and billions of dollars” from schools via “taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments” at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.

As in other policy areas, Trump isn’t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online “American Academy” offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. “It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none of that’s going to be allowed,” Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.

Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid

Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.

Affordable Care Act and Health Care

As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the “concepts of a plan.” In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of “making America healthy again.”

Climate and energy

Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a “hoax,” blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy – and transportation infrastructure spending – anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. “Drill, baby, drill!” was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.

Workers’ rights

Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America’s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden’s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump “the union bosses and CEOs” together as complicit in “this disastrous electric car scheme.” In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, “I’m telling you, you shouldn’t pay those dues.”

National defense and America’s role in the world

Trump’s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield — an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: “peace through strength.” But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. “I don’t consider them leaders,” Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans “see on television.” He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

He’s prioritizing loyalists for top jobs.

Trump was bruised and hampered by internal squabbles during his initial term in office. Now he appears focused on remaking the federal government in his own image. Some of his choices could face difficult confirmation battles even with Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate. One candidate, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump’s choice for attorney general, has withdrawn.

Here’s a look at whom he has selected so far.

Cabinet nominees:

TREASURY SECRETARY: Scott Bessent

Bessent, 62, is a former George Soros money manager and an advocate for deficit reduction.

He’s the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation’s first openly gay treasury secretary.

He told Bloomberg in August that he decided to join Trump’s campaign in part to attack the mounting U.S. national debt. That would include slashing government programs and other spending.

“This election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,” he said then.

SECRETARY OF STATE: Marco Rubio

Trump named Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to be secretary of state, making the critic-turned-ally his choice for top diplomat.

Rubio, 53, is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate on the Republican ticket last summer. Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The announcement punctuates the hard pivot Rubio has made with Trump, whom the senator once called a “con man” during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

Their relationship improved dramatically while Trump was in the White House. And as Trump campaigned for the presidency a third time, Rubio cheered his proposals. For instance, Rubio, who more than a decade ago helped craft immigration legislation that included a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally, now supports Trump’s plan to use the U.S. military for mass deportations.

DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Tulsi Gabbard

Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by Trump to be director of national intelligence, another example of Trump prizing loyalty over experience.

Gabbard, 43, was a Democratic House member who unsuccessfully sought the party’s 2020 presidential nomination before leaving the party in 2022. She endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him this fall, and she’s been accused of echoing Russian propaganda.

Gabbard, who has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait, would come to the role as an outsider compared to her predecessor. The current director, Avril Haines, was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in a number of top national security and intelligence positions.

DEFENSE SECRETARY: Pete Hegseth

Hegseth, 44, was a co-host of Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends Weekend” and has been a contributor with the network since 2014. He developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show.

Hegseth served in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2021, deploying to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2011. He has two Bronze Stars. However, Hegseth lacks senior military and national security experience. If confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit the top job during a series of global crises — ranging from Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies to the push for a cease-fire between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea.

Hegseth is also the author of “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,” published earlier this year.

ATTORNEY GENERAL: Pam Bondi

Bondi, 59, has been tapped by Trump to be Attorney General after U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration.

She was Florida’s first female attorney general serving between 2011 and 2019. She was on Trump’s legal team during his first impeachment trial in 2020.

Considered a loyalist, she has served as part of a Trump-allied outside group that has helped lay the groundwork for his future administration called the America First Policy Institute.

Bondi was among a group of Republicans who showed up to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial in New York that ended in May with a conviction on 34 felony counts. A fierce defender of Trump, she also frequently appears on Fox News and has been a critic of the criminal cases against him.

LABOR SECRETARY: Lori Chavez-DeRemer

Oregon Republican U.S. Rep. Chavez-DeRemer narrowly lost her reelection bid earlier this month, but received strong backing from union members in her district.

As a potential labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer would oversee the Labor Department’s workforce, its budget and put forth priorities that impact workers’ wages, health and safety, ability to unionize, and employer’s rights to fire employers, among other responsibilities.

Chavez-DeRemer is one of few House Republicans to endorse the “Protecting the Right to Organize” or PRO Act would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers’ rights. The act would also weaken “right-to-work” laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment.

COMMERCE SECRETARY: Howard Lutnick

Lutnick heads up the brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and is a cryptocurrency enthusiast. He is co-chair of Trump’s transition operation, charged along with Linda McMahon, a former wrestling executive who previously led Trump’s Small Business Administration, with helping the president-elect build a Cabinet for his second administration.

As commerce secretary, Lutnick would play a key role in carrying out Trump’s plans to raise and enforce tariffs. He would oversee a sprawling Cabinet department whose oversight ranges from funding new computer chip factories and imposing trade restrictions to releasing economic data and monitoring the weather.

HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Kristi Noem

Noem is a well-known conservative who used her two terms as South Dakota’s governor to vault to a prominent position in Republican politics.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Noem did not order restrictions that other states had issued and instead declared her state “open for business.” Trump held a fireworks rally at Mount Rushmore in July 2020 in one of the first large gatherings of the pandemic.

More recently, Noem faced sharp criticism for telling a story in her memoir about shooting and killing her dog.

She is set to lead a department crucial to the president-elect’s hardline immigration agenda as well as other missions. Homeland Security oversees natural disaster response, the U.S. Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration agents who work at airports.

CIA DIRECTOR: John Ratcliffe

Ratcliffe, a former U.S. House member from Texas, was director of national intelligence during the final year and a half of Trump’s first term, leading the U.S. government’s spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.

If confirmed, Ratcliffe will have held the highest intelligence positions in the U.S.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat, then as an independent, and then endorsed Trump. He’s the son of Democratic icon Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated during his own presidential campaign.

The nomination alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. For example, he has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism.

AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: Brooke Rollins

Trump said he will nominate Rollins to be his agriculture secretary. Rollins, 52, was his last announced pick to lead executive agencies.

The Texas attorney is a longtime associate who served as Trump’s domestic policy chief and director of his office of American innovation in his first term. She is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for the second Trump administration.

She previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: Sean Duffy

Duffy is a former House member from Wisconsin who was one of Trump’s most visible defenders on cable news. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, sitting on the Financial Services Committee and chairing the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019 for a TV career and has been the host of “The Bottom Line” on Fox Business.

Before entering politics, Duffy was a reality TV star on MTV, where he met his wife, “Fox and Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy. They have nine children.

VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY: Doug Collins

Collins is a former Republican congressman from Georgia who gained recognition for defending Trump during his first impeachment trial, which centered on U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump was impeached for urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in 2019 during the Democratic presidential nomination, but he was acquitted by the Senate.

Collins has also served in the armed forces himself and is currently a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command.

INTERIOR SECRETARY: Doug Burgum

The governor of North Dakota, once little-known outside his state, is a former Republican presidential primary contender who endorsed Trump and then spent months traveling to drum up support for Trump after dropping out of the race.

Burgum was a serious contender to be Trump’s vice presidential choice this summer. The two-term governor was seen as a possible pick because of his executive experience and business savvy. Burgum also has close ties to deep-pocketed energy industry CEOs.

Trump initially announced his choice of Burgum while addressing a gala at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His formal announcement the following day said he wanted Burgum to be Interior secretary and chairman of a new National Energy Council. Burgum will also have a seat on the National Security Council, which would be a first for the Interior secretary.

ENERGY SECRETARY: Chris Wright

A campaign donor and CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Write is a vocal advocate of oil and gas development, including fracking — a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

Wright also has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” The Energy Department is responsible for advancing energy, environmental and nuclear security of the United States.

Wright also won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term.

EDUCATION SECRETARY: Linda McMahon

McMahon, a billionaire professional wrestling mogul, would be making a return appearance in a second Trump administration. She led the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019 during Trump’s first term and twice ran unsuccessfully in Connecticut as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. She served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009 and has spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University. She has expressed support for charter schools and school choice.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: Lee Zeldin

Zeldin does not appear to have any experience in environmental issues, but is a longtime supporter of the former president. The 44-year-old former U.S. House member from New York wrote on X, “We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.”

“We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,” he added.

During his campaign, Trump often attacked the Biden administration’s promotion of electric vehicles, and incorrectly referred to a tax credit for EV purchases as a government mandate. Trump also often told his audiences during the campaign that his administration would “drill, baby, drill,” referring to his support for expanded petroleum exploration.

HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: Scott Turner

Turner is a former NFL player and White House aide. He ran the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump’s first term in office. Trump, in a statement, credited Turner, the highest-ranking Black person he’s yet selected for his administration, with “helping to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities.”

___

White House staff:

CHIEF OF STAFF: Susie Wiles

Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager.

She has a background in Florida politics, helping Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump’s defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary.

Wiles’ hire was Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with him. Wiles is said to have earned Trump’s trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump’s three presidential campaigns.

Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Mike Waltz

Waltz is a three-term Republican congressman from east-central Florida. A former Army Green Beret, he served multiple tours in Afghanistan and also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs.

He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.

BORDER CZAR: Tom Homan

Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump’s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation’s history.

He led the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Trump’s first administration and said at a conference over the summer that he would be willing to “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”

Democrats have criticized Homan for defending Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.

OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Russell Vought

Vought held the position during Trump’s first presidency.

After Trump’s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as “renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.”

Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term that he tried to distance himself from during the campaign.

Vought has also previously worked as the executive and budget director for the Republican Study Committee, a caucus for conservative House Republicans. He also worked at Heritage Action, the political group tied to The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR POLICY: Stephen Miller

Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump’s priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump’s first administration.

Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump’s policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families. Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation’s economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally.

DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Dan Scavino

Scavino was an adviser in all three of the president-elect’s campaigns, and the transition team referred to him as one of “Trump’s longest serving and most trusted aides.” He will be deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president. He previously ran Trump’s social media profile in the White House during his first administration.

DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: James Blair

Blair was political director for Trump’s 2024 campaign and for the Republican National Committee. He will be deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs and assistant to the president. Blair was key to Trump’s economic messaging during his winning White House comeback campaign.

DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Taylor Budowich

Budowich is a veteran Trump campaign aide who launched and directed Make America Great Again, Inc., a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 campaign. He will be deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel and assistant to the president.

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Karoline Leavitt

Leavitt, 27, was Trump’s campaign press secretary and currently a spokesperson for his transition. She would be the youngest White House press secretary in history.

Leavitt worked in the White House press office during Trump’s first term.

In 2022, she ran for Congress in New Hampshire, winning a 10-way Republican primary before losing to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas.

WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: William McGinley

McGinley was White House Cabinet secretary during Trump’s first administration, and was outside legal counsel for the Republican National Committee’s election integrity effort during the 2024 campaign.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: Dr. Marty Makary

Makary is a Johns Hopkins surgeon and author who argued against pandemic lockdowns. During the pandemic he routinely appeared on Fox News and wrote opinion articles questioning mask for children. He cast doubt on vaccine mandates but supported vaccines generally. And he also cast doubt on whether booster shots worked, which was against federal recommendations on the vaccine.

He authored “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health.”

SURGEON GENERAL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat

Nesheiwat is a general practitioner who serve as medical director for CityMD, a network of urgent care centers in New York and New Jersey. And she’s contributor on Fox News.

DIRECTOR OF U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL: Dr. Dave Weldon

Weldon recently ran for a Florida state legislative seat and lost; Trump backed the other candidate to win.

He also spent many years as a Florida Congressman and weighed in on one of the nation’s most heated debates of the 1990s over quality of life and a right-to-die and whether Terri Schiavo, who was in a persistent vegetative after cardiac arrest, state should have been allowed to have her feeding tube removed. He sided with the parents who did not want it removed.

Ambassadors and envoys and other key posts

SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST: Steven Witkoff

The 67-year-old Witkoff is the president-elect’s golf partner and was golfing with him at Trump’s club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15, when the former president was the target of a second attempted assassination.

Trump also named Witkoff co-chair, with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, of his inaugural committee.

AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Mike Huckabee

Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and his intended nomination comes as Trump has promised to align U.S. foreign policy more closely with Israel’s interests as it wages wars against the Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.

Huckabee, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016, has been a popular figure among evangelical Christian conservatives, many of whom support Israel due to Old Testament writings that Jews are God’s chosen people and that Israel is their rightful homeland.

Huckabee has rejected a Palestinian homeland in territory occupied by Israel, calling for a so-called “one-state solution.”

AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Elise Stefanik

Stefanik is a U.S. representative from New York and one of Trump’s staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.

Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.

Stefanik’s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.

AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Matthew Whitaker

A former acting attorney general during Trump’s first administration and tight end on the University of Iowa football team, Whitaker, 55, has a background in law enforcement but not in foreign policy.

A fierce Trump localist, Whitaker, is also a former U.S. attorney in Iowa and served as acting attorney general between November 2018 and February 2019 without Senate confirmation, until William Barr was confirmed for the role. That was when special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference was drawing to a close.

Whitaker also faced questions about his past business dealings, including his ties to an invention-promotion company that was accused of misleading consumers.

AMBASSADOR TO CANADA: Pete Hoekstra

A Republican congressman from Michigan who served from 1993 to 2011, Hoekstra was ambassador to the Netherlands during Trump’s first term.

“In my Second Term, Pete will help me once again put AMERICA FIRST,” Trump said in a statement announcing his choice. “He did an outstanding job as United States Ambassador to the Netherlands during our first four years, and I am confident that he will continue to represent our Country well in this new role.”

CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES: Dr. Mehmet Oz

Oz, 64, is a former heart surgeon who hosted “The Dr. Oz Show,” a long-running daytime television talk show. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 2022 and is an outspoken supporter of Trump, who endorsed Oz’s bid for elected office.

WITHDRAWN

Matt Gaetz for ATTORNEY GENERAL

Gaetz, 42, withdrew from consideration to become the top law enforcement officer of the United States amid fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed by the Senate.

Trump had announced Gaetz as his choice for attorney general on Nov. 13, passing over more established lawyers whose names had been floated as possible contenders for the job.

Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced him. The House Ethics Committee has been investigating an allegation that he paid for sex with a 17-year-old.

Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Donald Trump Isn’t the Only Chaos Agent - WIRED,"Eight years ago, the November US election results profoundly shocked the small staff at Backchannel, the boutique tech publication I headed. The morning after, an editor posted on our Slack that working on a technology story seemed tone-deaf, if not futile. On a plane from New York to San Francisco, I wrote a column to answer that impulse, directed as much to myself and my colleagues as it was to readers. I argued that regardless of the enormity of this event, one thing hadn’t changed; the biggest story of our time was still the technological revolution we were living through. Disruptive politicians, even destructive ones, may come and go—or refuse to go. But the chip, the network, the mobile device, and all they entailed were changing humanity, and maybe what it will mean to be human. Our job was to chronicle that epic transformation, no matter who was politically in charge. The headline of my column was “The iPhone Is Bigger Than Donald Trump.”

This week, Trump was once again elected president despite … oh hell, I won’t go through the litany of what would seem to be slam-dunk disqualifiers. You’ve heard it all, and to the majority of voters it doesn’t matter. It’s an unbelievable story, and the next few years will undoubtedly be the stuff of history. Maybe not in a good way. Maybe in a very bad way for a country where many expected to celebrate its continuing values on America's 250th birthday. (In the spirit of unity, I’ll use the “maybe” qualifier since losers should be humble, and who knows what’s ahead.)

Yet I’m not budging from the thought I had in 2016. As Stewart Brand once said, “Human nature doesn’t change much; science does, and the change accrues, altering the world irreversibly.” What is happening in technology and science remains the activity that will ultimately make the biggest impact on our species. Hundreds of years later, future generations (and possibly Ray Kurzweil) will look back at this time and identify it as the period when microchips and neural net software changed everything. And who was that strongman with the funny hair who crashed the country that used to occupy real estate in the Western Hemisphere? I no longer run a publication and instead represent but a single voice in a much larger staff. (For WIRED’s institutional view, please note the words of my boss, which I endorse.) So, speaking for myself, I emphatically reprise my 2016 statement of purpose, with a slight tweak: Artificial intelligence is bigger than Donald Trump.

Of course journalists must cover Trump’s second presidency vigorously, with relentless demands for accountability. In the short term—for some of us codgers it may be all of our remaining term!—what happens in our community and country will have a bigger influence on our daily lives than the latest version of Claude, ChatGPT, or even Apple Intelligence. (Sorry, Tim Apple.) If you lose your health care, or your reproductive rights, or find yourself in a deportation camp or a prison cell because of the policies of our returning president, the knowledge that AI, mixed reality, and quantum computers might one day redefine us won’t lessen the pain.

Also, those of us covering tech will definitely wind up reporting on the Trump presidency; policy as always affects the course of technology. (Remember, the US government produced that thing called the internet.) Right now a debate is raging about how, or whether, we should regulate or restrain AI, a technology which some refer to as “the last invention.” I’m already hearing discussions about the new administration nixing the elaborate executive order on AI that Joe Biden mandated. Some worry that the new president’s mega-adviser Elon Musk—who has his own AI company and builds AI into his other enterprises, like Tesla and Neuralink—will have an outsize and possibly inappropriate influence on government policies and contracts. I’ve also heard speculation that the movement to regulate AI might be, um, trumped by the threat of China’s full-throated efforts in the field. That’s important, because the ground rules of today’s AI, and the quirks of its inventors, may affect whether the worst fears about the technology come true.

That’s why, the day after Donald Trump got reelected, I visited an AI company and interviewed one of its leaders and a top engineer. Yes, on the walk back to the office I thought about the election results and got depressed all over again. But I will finish the article about that company, and then do another, sticking to the tech beat for as long as my broken heart keeps beating. AI, after all, is still the biggest story in town.",Donald Trump Isn’t the Only Chaos Agent  WIRED,WIRED,https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-donald-trump-isnt-the-only-chaos-agent/
"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,What Donald Trump’s Win Means For AI - TIME,"When Donald Trump was last President, ChatGPT had not yet been launched. Now, as he prepares to return to the White House after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, the artificial intelligence landscape looks quite different.

AI systems are advancing so rapidly that some leading executives of AI companies, such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and a prominent Trump backer, believe AI may become smarter than humans by 2026. Others offer a more general timeframe. In an essay published in September, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days,” but also noted that “it may take longer.” Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees the arrival of these systems as more of a gradual process rather than a single moment.

Either way, such advances could have far-reaching implications for national security, the economy, and the global balance of power.

Trump’s own pronouncements on AI have fluctuated between awe and apprehension. In a June interview on Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast, he described AI as a “superpower” and called its capabilities “alarming.” And like many in Washington, he views the technology through the lens of competition with China, which he sees as the “primary threat” in the race to build advanced AI.

Yet even his closest allies are divided on how to govern the technology: Musk has long voiced concerns about AI’s existential risks, while J.D. Vance, Trump's Vice President, sees such warnings from industry as a ploy to usher regulations that would “entrench the tech incumbents.” These divisions among Trump's confidants hint at the competing pressures that will shape AI policy during Trump’s second term.

Undoing Biden’s AI legacy

Trump’s first major AI policy move will likely be to repeal President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on AI. The sweeping order, signed in October 2023, sought to address threats the technology could pose to civil rights, privacy, and national security, while promoting innovation, competition, and the use of AI for public services.

Trump promised to repeal the Executive Order on the campaign trail in December 2023, and this position was reaffirmed in the Republican Party platform in July, which criticized the executive order for hindering innovation and imposing “radical leftwing ideas” on the technology’s development.

Sections of the Executive Order which focus on racial discrimination or inequality are “not as much Trump’s style,” says Dan Hendrycks, executive and research director of the Center for AI Safety. While experts have criticized any rollback of bias protections, Hendrycks says the Trump Administration may preserve other aspects of Biden's approach. “I think there's stuff in [the Executive Order] that's very bipartisan, and then there's some other stuff that's more specifically Democrat-flavored,” Hendrycks says.

“It would not surprise me if a Trump executive order on AI maintained or even expanded on some of the core national security provisions within the Biden Executive Order, building on what the Department of Homeland Security has done for evaluating cybersecurity, biological, and radiological risks associated with AI,” says Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, a technology-focused think tank.

The fate of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), an institution created last November by the Biden Administration to lead the government's efforts on AI safety, also remains uncertain. In August, the AISI signed agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic to formally collaborate on AI safety research, and on the testing and evaluation of new models. “Almost certainly, the AI Safety Institute is viewed as an inhibitor to innovation, which doesn't necessarily align with the rest of what appears to be Trump's tech and AI agenda,” says Keegan McBride, a lecturer in AI, government, and policy at the Oxford Internet Institute. But Hammond says that while some fringe voices would move to shutter the institute, “most Republicans are supportive of the AISI. They see it as an extension of our leadership in AI.”

Read more: What Trump’s Win Means for Crypto

Congress is already working on protecting the AISI. In October, a broad coalition of companies, universities, and civil society groups—including OpenAI, Lockheed Martin, Carnegie Mellon University, and the nonprofit Encode Justice—signed a letter calling on key figures in Congress to urgently establish a legislative basis for the AISI. Efforts are underway in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and both reportedly have “pretty wide bipartisan support,” says Hamza Chaudhry, U.S. policy specialist at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute.

America-first AI and the race against China

Trump’s previous comments suggest that maintaining the U.S.’s lead in AI development will be a key focus for his Administration.“We have to be at the forefront,” he said on the Impaulsive podcast in June. “We have to take the lead over China.” Trump also framed environmental concerns as potential obstacles, arguing they could ""hold us back"" in what he views as the race against China.

Trump's AI policy could include rolling back regulations to accelerate infrastructure development, says Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University. ""There's the data centers that are going to have to be built. The energy to power those data centers is going to be immense. I think even bigger than that: chip production,"" he says. “We're going to need a lot more chips.” While Trump’s campaign has at times attacked the CHIPS Act, which provides incentives for chip makers manufacturing in the U.S, leading some analysts to believe that he is unlikely to repeal the act.

Read more: What Donald Trump’s Win Means for the Economy

Chip export restrictions are likely to remain a key lever in U.S. AI policy. Building on measures he initiated during his first term—which were later expanded by Biden—Trump may well strengthen controls that curb China's access to advanced semiconductors. ""It's fair to say that the Biden Administration has been pretty tough on China, but I'm sure Trump wants to be seen as tougher,"" McBride says. It is “quite likely” that Trump’s White House will “double down” on export controls in an effort to close gaps that have allowed China to access chips, says Scott Singer, a visiting scholar in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The overwhelming majority of people on both sides think that the export controls are important,” he says.

The rise of open-source AI presents new challenges. China has shown it can leverage U.S. systems, as demonstrated when Chinese researchers reportedly adapted an earlier version of Meta's Llama model for military applications. That’s created a policy divide. ""You've got people in the GOP that are really in favor of open-source,"" Ball says. ""And then you have people who are 'China hawks' and really want to forbid open-source at the frontier of AI.""

""My sense is that because a Trump platform has so much conviction in the importance and value of open-source I'd be surprised to see a movement towards restriction,"" Singer says.

Despite his tough talk, Trump's deal-making impulses could shape his policy towards China. ""I think people misunderstand Trump as a China hawk. He doesn't hate China,"" Hammond says, describing Trump's ""transactional"" view of international relations. In 2018, Trump lifted restrictions on Chinese technology company ZTE in exchange for a $1.3 billion fine and increased oversight. Singer sees similar possibilities for AI negotiations, particularly if Trump accepts concerns held by many experts about AI’s more extreme risks, such as the chance that humanity may lose control over future systems.

Trump’s coalition is divided over AI

Debates over how to govern AI reveal deep divisions within Trump's coalition of supporters. Leading figures, including Vance, favor looser regulations of the technology. Vance has dismissed AI risk as an industry ploy to usher in new regulations that would “make it actually harder for new entrants to create the innovation that’s going to power the next generation of American growth.”

Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who served on Trump’s 2016 transition team, recently cautioned against movements to regulate AI. Speaking at the Cambridge Union in May, he said any government with the authority to govern the technology would have a “global totalitarian character.” Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, gave $2.5 million to a pro-Trump super political action committee, and an additional $844,600 to Trump’s campaign and the Republican Party.

Yet, a more safety-focused perspective has found other supporters in Trump's orbit. Hammond, who advised on the AI policy committee for Project 2025, a proposed policy agenda led by right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, and not officially endorsed by the Trump campaign, says that “within the people advising that project, [there was a] very clear focus on artificial general intelligence and catastrophic risks from AI.”

Musk, who has emerged as a prominent Trump campaign ally through both his donations and his promotion of Trump on his platform X (formerly Twitter), has long been concerned that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity. Recently, Musk said he believes there’s a 10% to 20% chance that AI “goes bad.” In August, Musk posted on X supporting the now-vetoed California AI safety bill that would have put guardrails on AI developers. Hendrycks, whose organization co-sponsored the California bill, and who serves as safety adviser at xAI, Musk’s AI company, says “If Elon is making suggestions on AI stuff, then I expect it to go well.” However, “there’s a lot of basic appointments and groundwork to do, which makes it a little harder to predict,” he says.

Trump has acknowledged some of the national security risks of AI. In June, he said he feared deepfakes of a U.S. President threatening a nuclear strike could prompt another state to respond, sparking a nuclear war. He also gestured to the idea that an AI system could “go rogue” and overpower humanity, but took care to distinguish this position from his personal view. However, for Trump, competition with China appears to remain the primary concern.

Read more: Trump Worries AI Deepfakes Could Trigger Nuclear War

But these priorities aren’t necessarily at odds and AI safety regulation does not inherently entail ceding ground to China, Hendrycks says. He notes that safeguards against malicious use require minimal investment from developers. “You have to hire one person to spend, like, a month or two on engineering, and then you get your jailbreaking safeguards,” he says. But with these competing voices shaping Trump's AI agenda, the direction of Trump’s AI policy agenda remains uncertain.

“In terms of which viewpoint President Trump and his team side towards, I think that is an open question, and that's just something we'll have to see,” says Chaudhry. “Now is a pivotal moment.”",What Donald Trump’s Win Means For AI  TIME,TIME,https://time.com/7174210/what-donald-trump-win-means-for-ai/

Former President Donald Trump has floated several tax A tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. policy ideas, including extending the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changes, bringing back the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), reducing the corporate tax rate for domestic production, exempting various types of income from the income tax, repealing green energy tax credits, and imposing steep new tariffs.

The impact of Trump’s proposals will vary significantly depending on which combination of policies are pursued and how exactly each policy is structured.

Some of Trump’s tax proposals are well-designed and would be efficient ways to promote long-run economic growth, such as permanent expensing for machinery, equipment, and research and development (R&D).

On the other hand, some of his tax proposals are poorly designed and would worsen the structure of the tax code while only creating a muted impact on long-run economic growth, such as the exemptions for tips and Social Security income.

Worse yet, Trump’s reliance on import tariffs to offset the cost of tax cuts comes with major downsides. Tariffs are a particularly distortive way to raise revenue, especially as they invite foreign retaliation. We estimate Trump’s proposed tariffs and partial retaliation from all trading partners would together offset more than two-thirds of the long-run economic benefit of his proposed tax cuts.

As with any economic model, ours does not capture all the possible effects of the proposed tax and tariff Tariffs are taxes imposed by one country on goods imported from another country. Tariffs are trade barriers that raise prices, reduce available quantities of goods and services for US businesses and consumers, and create an economic burden on foreign exporters. policies, such as changes in compliance costs, the geopolitical implications of further trade wars, the impact of different tax burdens on different sectors and types of investments, or how uncertainty affects economic decision-making.

Our estimates illustrate that Trump’s proposed tariffs threaten to offset much of the economic benefits of his proposed tax policy changes, and of those proposed tax policy changes, many move in the opposite direction of simple, pro-growth, and fiscally responsible tax reform.

Modeling the Major Provisions Proposed by Candidate Trump

Trump has suggested a wide variety of tax and tariff proposals and frequently proposes new ideas on the campaign trail. For this update of our details and analysis on Trump’s tax policies, we model the following major proposals, effective beginning January 1, 2025, unless otherwise stated:

Making the individual TCJA expirations permanent except for the cap on SALT (effective January 1, 2026) Rates and brackets Standard deduction The standard deduction reduces a taxpayer’s taxable income by a set amount determined by the government. It was nearly doubled for all classes of filers by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as an incentive for taxpayers not to itemize deductions when filing their federal income taxes. Personal exemption Child tax credit A tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer’s final tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. A tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions, which reduce taxable income, rather than the taxpayer’s tax bill directly. Limitations on itemized deductions (excluding SALT) and elimination of Pease limitation AMT changes Section 199A pass-through deduction and noncorporate loss limitation

Making the TCJA estate tax An estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual’s taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. The tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs.

Restoring the TCJA business tax provisions (effective January 1, 2026) 100 percent bonus depreciation Bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain “short-lived” investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings in the first year. Allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. R&D expensing EBITDA-based interest limitation

Reinstituting the domestic production activities deduction (DPAD) at 28.5 percent to lower the effective corporate tax rate for domestic production to 15 percent

Exempting tips from income taxes

Exempting Social Security benefits from income taxes

Exempting overtime pay from income taxes

Creating an itemized deduction Itemized deductions allow individuals to subtract designated expenses from their taxable income and can be claimed in lieu of the standard deduction. Itemized deductions include those for state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and mortgage interest. An estimated 13.7 percent of filers itemized in 2019, most being high-income taxpayers.

Eliminating the green energy subsidies in the Inflation Inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spending power.

Raising current Section 301 tariffs on China to 60 percent

Imposing a universal tariff on all US imports of 20 percent

Foreign retaliation of 10 percent on all US exports plus additional in-kind tariffs on US exports to China

We exclude from our formal modeling an idea floated by vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) to increase the child tax credit to $5,000—as the campaign has not confirmed support of the proposal—as well as Trump’s recent proposal to end double taxation Double taxation is when taxes are paid twice on the same dollar of income, regardless of whether that’s corporate or individual income. of Americans abroad, though we include the potential cost of both policies in our range of potential budgetary estimates below. We also exclude the proposal to create a tax credit for family caregivers, as the campaign has not specified a design.

Economic Effects of Trump’s Tax Proposals

Using the Tax Foundation’s General Equilibrium Model, we estimate Trump’s tax proposals would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent, the capital stock by 1.7 percent, wages by 0.8 percent, and employment by 597,000 full-time equivalent jobs.

We estimate the proposals would increase the 10-year budget deficit by $3 trillion conventionally and $2.5 trillion dynamically. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase from its long-run projected level of 201.2 percent to 223.1 percent on a conventional basis and 217 percent on a dynamic basis. Increased deficits and a higher debt load would require higher interest payments on the debt that would reduce American incomes as measured by GNP by almost 0.8 percent; the higher interest payments drive a wedge between the long-run effect on output of 0.8 percent and the long-run effect on GNP of -0.1 percent.

Table 1. Economic Effects of Trump’s Tax Proposals

GDP 0.8% GNP -0.1% Capital Stock 1.7% Wages 0.8% Full-Time Equivalent Employment 597,000 Baseline Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 2065 201.2% Conventional Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 2065 223.1% Dynamic Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 2065 217.0%

Source: Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, October 2024.

Permanence for the individual, estate, and business tax provisions of the TCJA would increase long-run economic output by a combined 1.1 percent when modeled with the cap on SALT deductions limited to $10,000. However, if Trump’s proposal to “get SALT back” means discontinuing the $10,000 SALT cap, removing the cap from TCJA permanence would boost GPD by an additional 0.7 percent, as the SALT cap creates a burden on labor income as well as housing investment.

Exempting tips, Social Security, and overtime pay from the income tax together boost long-run output by 0.4 percent, most of which comes from exempting overtime pay. Creating an itemized deduction for auto loan interest would lead to a slight additional boost in output.

We modeled Trump’s proposed 15 percent corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturing as a restoration of the prior DPAD set at 28.5 percent to reach an effective corporate tax rate of 15 percent. By lowering the effective corporate tax rate for a subset of corporations, it would increase long-run economic output by 0.2 percent.

Trump has also proposed eliminating the green energy tax credits put in place by the IRA. Because the IRA tax credits are temporary expansions, we do not find a long-run economic impact from eliminating them.

We estimate the proposal to impose a universal 20 percent tariff on all imports plus additionally raise the tariff on imports from China to 60 percent (the current Section 301 tariffs result in a weighted-average tariff rate on imports from China of about 10 percent), would shrink long-run economic output by about 1.3 percent. To illustrate the potential harms from foreign retaliation, we estimate the impact of a 10 percent tariff on all goods exports plus additional in-kind retaliation on US goods exports to China. We estimate retaliation would reduce US GDP by an additional 0.4 percent in the long run while raising no additional revenue for the US government.

Revenue Effects of Trump’s Tax Proposals

On a conventional basis, we estimate Trump’s proposed tax changes would reduce federal tax revenue by $3 trillion from 2025 through 2034. The revenue loss falls to $2.5 trillion on a dynamic basis.

Permanence for the individual provisions of the TCJA would reduce revenue by $3.4 trillion if the SALT cap is made permanent, but extending the individual provisions without a cap on SALT would add another $1 trillion to the 10-year estimate, resulting in a combined $4.4 trillion reduction in revenue. Permanence for the estate tax changes would reduce revenue by $205 billion while permanently reversing the phaseout of bonus depreciation Depreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and discouraging investment. , the amortization of R&D expenses, and the tightening of the business net interest deduction (restoring the deduction to 30 percent of EBITDA rather than EBIT) would reduce revenue by another $643 billion. Altogether, permanence for the individual, estate, and business tax provisions without a cap on SALT would reduce revenue by $5.3 billion. Retroactive restoration of the business tax provisions could add billions more that we do not account for here.

The five additional major tax cuts proposed by Trump—exempting tips, Social Security, and overtime pay from income tax; creating an itemized deduction for auto loan interest; and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent for domestic production—add another $2.5 trillion to the 10-year revenue reduction.

To offset part of the nearly $7.8 trillion of tax reductions, Trump has proposed repealing the IRA green energy credits, which we estimate would raise about $921 billion over 10 years, and imposing steep new tariffs, which we estimate would raise about $3.8 trillion over 10 years.

Distributional Effects of Trump’s Tax Proposals

Overall, Trump has outlined significant tax proposals that would decrease after-tax income After-tax income is the net amount of income available to invest, save, or consume after federal, state, and withholding taxes have been applied—your disposable income. Companies and, to a lesser extent, individuals, make economic decisions in light of how they can best maximize their earnings. on average by 1.4 percent in 2025 and increase after-tax income by 2.2 percent in 2034. The difference between 2025 and 2034 is primarily because the TCJA provisions do not expire until 2026, and so extending them does not have an effect in 2025. On a long-run dynamic basis, we estimate that after-tax incomes would increase by 2.8 percent on average, reflecting the 0.8 percent increase in economic output under the plan.

However, the tax changes Trump has proposed would not be felt evenly across all income groups. In general, Trump has proposed tax cuts that provide a larger relative benefit to higher-income taxpayers, while his major proposed offset of higher import tariffs falls harder on lower- and middle-income taxpayers.

In 2034, we estimate the bottom 40 percent of households would see tax increases, on average, with after tax income falling by 0.6 percent for the bottom quintile and by 0.4 percent for taxpayers in the 20th to 40th percentile. Middle income taxpayers would see very slight tax cuts on average, with after-tax income increasing by 0.3 percent in 2034. The top two quintiles would see the largest increases in after-tax income, ranging from 1.4 percent for taxpayers in the 60th to 80th percentile to 3.1 percent for the top quintile. Increases for the top 1 percent are even larger, reaching 4.1 percent in 2034. In the long run, accounting for economic growth, all income groups would see an increase in after-tax income, although higher income earners would see a larger increase.

Potential Deficit Impact of Trump’s Tax Proposals

Across the major proposals we formally scored, we estimate revenue would fall by $3 trillion on a conventional basis and by $2.5 trillion on a dynamic basis from 2025 through 2034. Trump’s proposals could be interpreted even more broadly, for example, the exemptions for overtime pay and tips could apply to the payroll tax A payroll tax is a tax paid on the wages and salaries of employees to finance social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Payroll taxes are social insurance taxes that comprise 24.8 percent of combined federal, state, and local government revenue, the second largest source of that combined tax revenue. in addition to the income tax. Sen. Vance has also floated the idea of a more broadly available $5,000 child tax credit, but the campaign has not confirmed support for the idea.

Trump also recently proposed ending the taxation of American’s abroad, which would further reduce revenue. Under current law, Americans are taxed on their worldwide earnings even if they live and earn income abroad. Some taxpayers can use foreign tax credits and the foreign earned income exclusion (FEIE) to reduce or entirely offset their US tax liabilities, but they must still navigate a complicated US tax filing process and sometimes pay tax twice to the US and to the foreign country where they reside.

Trump would move the US to a residence-based tax system for individuals living abroad so they could forego filing and paying US income tax. This proposal would likely reduce federal revenue by between $50 billion and $100 billion over 10 years on a conventional basis. This revenue loss could be offset via new revenue from transition taxes or fees under the new regime, but Trump has not yet specified such details.

The campaign has also not specified any details for the proposed tax credit for family caregivers. While House and Senate lawmakers have shown bipartisan support for the Credit for Caring Act, which would provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 for eligible caregivers, Trump has not specified support for this specific design, so we have not scored his proposal.

Considering these other potential tax cuts, we find Trump’s tax plans could reduce revenue by nearly twice as much as our formally scored estimates indicate, potentially adding up to $6 trillion in net tax cuts over 10 years.

Modeling Notes

TCJA Permanence

We assume TCJA permanence entails the following changes, described here in our recent publication:

Lower rates and reconfigured brackets

Larger standard deduction

Eliminated personal exemption

Larger child tax credit

Limited itemized deductions for home mortgage interest and miscellaneous expenses but allow unlimited SALT deductions

Eliminated Pease limitation

Larger AMT exemption and exemption phaseout thresholds

20 percent deduction for pass-through business A pass-through business is a sole proprietorship, partnership, or S corporation that is not subject to the corporate income tax; instead, this business reports its income on the individual income tax returns of the owners and is taxed at individual income tax rates.

Larger estate tax exemption A tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax.

100 percent bonus depreciation

Expensing for research and development

Deduction for net interest limitation based on EBITDA

Tariffs

To model the economic effects of tariffs, we treat them as an excise tax An excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity. Excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, soda, gasoline, insurance premiums, amusement activities, and betting, and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and, to a lesser extent, federal tax collections. applied to US imports. As an excise tax, tariffs create a wedge between the price a consumer pays and the price a producer receives. In Tax Foundation’s modeling, we hold the price level constant, passing tariffs back to the factors of production. In other words, tariffs reduce the amount of revenue businesses have to compensate their workers and shareholders, resulting in a reduction in real incomes.

To model the revenue effects of US-imposed tariffs, we first shrink the tax base The tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates. using an elasticity of import demand of -0.997. From there, we multiply the import tax base by the inclusive tariff rate (the rate divided by one plus the rate) to estimate initial tariff revenue. To estimate how total tax revenue changes, we apply a compliance rate of 85 percent, based on the average tax gap The tax gap is the difference between taxes legally owed and taxes collected. The gross tax gap in the U.S. accounts for at least 1 billion in lost revenue each year, according to the latest estimate by the IRS (2011 to 2013), suggesting a voluntary taxpayer compliance rate of 83.6 percent. The net tax gap is calculated by subtracting late tax collections from the gross tax gap: from 2011 to 2013, the average net gap was around 1 billion. , and income and payroll tax offsets of approximately 27 percent. If imports are more responsive than we have estimated, tariff revenues would be lower. On a dynamic basis, revenue falls further as tariffs and foreign retaliation result in a reduction in real incomes and output.

15 Percent Rate for Domestic Production

We modeled Trump’s proposal for a 15 percent rate on domestic production as a restoration of the DPAD that was in effect from 2004 to 2017. To reach an effective tax rate of 15 percent, we set the deduction value at 28.5 percent ((21% * (1 -.285) = 15%)).

Tips

To estimate the revenue effect of exempting tips from income tax, we projected a baseline of tip income by taking tips as a share of total wage income based on 2018 data, assumed a 10 percent increase in tips, and applied the marginal tax rate on wages faced by taxpayers making between $30,000 and $40,000 under TCJA policy.

Auto Loan Interest Deductions

We use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to estimate auto loans held by households at different income levels and derive the interest payments on auto loans by income level. We use Tax Foundation model data to estimate itemized deductions of these interest payments and conventional revenue effects and distributional impacts over the budget window. We grow the revenue over the budget window by changes in projected aggregate auto loan amounts and CBO’s forecast of future interest rates. We model the macroeconomic effect of this proposal as a reduction in the marginal tax rate The marginal tax rate is the amount of additional tax paid for every additional dollar earned as income. The average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. A 10 percent marginal tax rate means that 10 cents of every next dollar earned would be taken as tax. on wage income.

Overtime Pay

We relied on the Consumer Population Survey (CPS) data to formulate a baseline estimate of overtime pay of 2.65 percent of salary and wage income overall, while the shares vary by quintile. We modeled overtime pay as a fixed portion of income by quintile, facing the marginal rate on wage income for each quintile under TCJA policy.

"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Making Tariffs Great Again: Does President Trump Have Legal Authority to Implement New Tariffs on U.S. Trading Partners and China? - Center for Strategic & International Studies,"Introduction

If former president Donald Trump wins back the White House, U.S. trading partners are likely to face a barrage of renewed tariff threats. Trump has announced that, if reelected, he will impose a 10–20 percent across-the-board tariff on imports into the United States, as well as an additional 60 percent tariff on all imports from China.

Trump has multiple potential sources of legal authority that could support his tariffs, if reelected, including Section 232, Section 301, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Section 122 Balance of Payments Authority, and even older statutes like Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Vice President Kamala Harris has blasted Trump’s tariff plan, arguing that it would represent a $3,900 sales tax on Americans and drive up prices and inflation.

That tariffs have reemerged as a central policy debate between the two presidential hopefuls has not only rattled allies and trading partners but also parts of the business community, which have been left in the political wilderness as both political parties compete to bash China and repudiate trade liberalization.

A key question is whether a president has the authority to implement the types of across-the-board tariffs being discussed by Trump. The U.S. Constitution plainly grants the power to impose tariffs to Congress, not the president: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations” (Article 1, Section 8). However, Congress has delegated extensive authorities that allow the president to impose tariffs if certain statutory conditions are met.

While some analysts have tried to reassure investors and markets by asserting that Trump would lack the legal authority to implement his tariffs plans, this reflects an overly optimistic view of the limits of presidential tariff authority. As of today, there are multiple legal authorities that Trump could rely on to justify the imposition of increased tariffs, including many that Trump already availed himself of during his presidency. These include Sections 232 and 301, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Section 122 Balance-of-Payments Authority, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. While Section 232 requires an investigation by the Department of Commerce and Section 301 requires an investigation and determination by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), these procedural niceties could be accomplished in relatively short order by cabinet officials, particularly since undue delay could put them at risk of getting fired. Regardless, any investigation or public comment period would allow anticipation to build, enhancing Trump’s negotiating leverage, which is likely one of the main points of the exercise.

Section 232

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (known as the Trade Expansion Act) grants the president broad power to adjust imports if they are found to be a threat to U.S. national security, including through the imposition of tariffs.

Trump has used Section 232 to impose 10–25 percent tariffs in the past. After the Department of Commerce determined in 2018 that the quantities and circumstances of steel and aluminum imports “threaten to impair U.S. national security,” then president Trump applied 25 percent tariffs on imports of steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum. While this tariff originally applied to all countries, exemptions were granted to Brazil, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina in exchange for quota arrangements, and Australia was exempted. While the Biden administration kept the Section 232 tariffs, it reached separate agreements with the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom on tariff-rate quota arrangements.

While some argue that it would be a stretch for Trump to claim that all imports are a threat to U.S. national security under Section 232, the courts have routinely deferred to presidents on foreign affairs and trade policy, and legal challenges to the Section 232 tariffs haven’t gone anywhere. USP Holdings, Inc. v. United States affirmed the Court of International Trade determination upholding the Trump administration’s Section 232 tariffs on steel imports, and American Institute for International Steel (AIIS) v. United States affirmed the Court of International Trade determination that Section 232 did not violate the Constitution’s Separation of Powers.

Section 301

Section 301(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 gives the president broad authority to take all appropriate action, including retaliatory tariffs, to obtain the removal of any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that is unjustified, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and that burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. If the USTR determines that the alleged conduct is unfair or violates U.S. rights under trade agreements, then it can decide what action to take subject to the direction of the president. Section 301 authorizes the USTR to (1) impose duties or other import restrictions, (2) withdraw or suspend trade agreement concessions, or (3) enter into binding agreements with foreign governments to eliminate the conduct in question or provide compensation.

Again, Trump used this authority to impose tariffs during his presidency. While the USTR initiated six investigations during the Trump administration, two investigations resulted in the imposition of tariffs. The first was on U.S. imports from China, due to China’s technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation policies, and led to 25.0 and 7.5 percent tariffs on roughly $370 billion worth of imports from China. The second was on imports from the European Union caused by EU subsidies on large civil aircraft, which led to additional tariffs of 15–25 percent on roughly $7.5 billion worth of imports from the European Union. Trump also launched 301 investigations into digital services taxes on a number of countries, as well as currency practices and timber from Vietnam.

Section 301 tariffs are an additional tool that could permit President Trump to impose a 10–20 percent tariff on all imports to the United States, as well as a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, as long as he finds that the acts of all U.S. trading partners are unfair.

International Emergency Economic Powers Act

The IEEPA provides broad presidential authority to deal with international economic emergencies, which Trump would almost certainly be prepared to find. Indeed, Trump nearly became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs in 2019, when he threatened a 5 percent across-the-board tariff on Mexican goods unless the country stemmed illegal migration into the United States. A deal was struck in 2019, rendering reliance on IEEPA unnecessary, but the option remains. While some argue that using IEEPA in this manner is contrary to the intent of the statute, the language is broad: “Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat . . . if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” IEEPA has been used to target specific countries as well as broader concerns involving export controls, human rights, security, and election interference. It is not a stretch to imagine a President Trump expanding IEEPA to address large U.S. trade deficits.

More importantly, IEEPA is the successor to the Trading with the Enemy Act, which President Nixon invoked in 1971 to justify a 10 percent import tariff due to a balance-of-payments crisis and which the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals upheld in Yoshida v. United States.

Section 122 Balance-of-Payments Authority

The president’s balance-of-payments authority in Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to impose an additional 15 percent tariff on imports for 150 days “Whenever fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to restrict imports—(1) to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits, (2) to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.” This authority was specifically added by Congress after President Nixon used the Trading with the Enemy Act (IEEPA’s predecessor) to impose a 10 percent surcharge on U.S. trading partners to address rising U.S. trade deficits and the overvaluation of the dollar under the Bretton Woods gold standard. However, this approach would limit the tariffs to a period of only 150 days (unless extended by Congress).

Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930

Finally, there are a number of older authorities that could be used to justify an increase in tariffs on imports from allies and adversaries alike. Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, for example, allows the president to impose additional tariffs up to 50 percent on any country that discriminates against U.S. products. Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 would also allow the president to block imports completely for any country that increases their discrimination against U.S. products. However, this provision hasn’t been used for over 70 years.

Legal Challenges

The use of any of these authorities to impose tariffs would likely be challenged by importers or other stakeholders. However, despite the Supreme Court’s recent decision in the June 2024 case Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, any legal challenges to future Trump tariffs likely would face a steep uphill climb. The courts, including the Supreme Court, traditionally have been reluctant to interfere with the president’s exercise of foreign affairs and tariff powers. For instance, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., the Supreme Court found that the president has certain inherent powers in foreign affairs that do not require an affirmative grant of statutory authority from Congress. In J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, it found that presidential authority under Section 315 of the Tariff Act was a valid constitutional delegation of authority as long as it sets out “intelligible principle.” Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc. upheld Section 232(b) tariffs on imported oil, after finding that Section 232 sets out an “intelligible principle” to guide presidential decisionmaking. Lastly, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided in Maple Leaf Fish Co. v. United States that courts have “a very limited role” in reviewing presidential trade actions “of a highly discretionary kind,” such as Section 201, and such actions can only be set aside if they involve “a clear misconstruction of the governing statute, a significant procedural violation, or action outside delegated authority.”

The Maple Leaf Fish Co. case is particularly important since the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over most trade law appeals. While precedent plays less of a role under the current Supreme Court, these past cases suggest that the courts are likely to take an especially deferential approach to executive branch decisions involving foreign policy, national security, and international economic policymaking, recognizing that it falls outside their normal purview and expertise. While the inevitable appeals to any litigation will take years to wind their way through the judicial system, from a business perspective, the real issue would be the immediate effect on costs, trade flows, and supply chains, and not on what might eventually be the legal outcome three years down the road.

While Congress always has the option of passing legislation to amend or revoke some of the president’s delegated tariff-setting authority, it’s difficult to see that happening with a veto-proof majority in the current political climate.

Conclusion

If Trump wins back the White House, U.S. trading partners are likely to face a barrage of renewed tariff threats, which has left many companies and trading partners struggling to better understand what measures may be coming. During Trump’s first term, he used tariffs for a variety of purposes, including diversifying supply chains (e.g., China), addressing global excess capacity (e.g., steel and aluminum), and for leverage in negotiations with Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico. Trump also has a longstanding view that U.S. average tariff rates are too low, a vestige of past General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rounds, the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements, and the World Trade Organization, which locked in U.S. tariffs through negotiated tariff “bindings.” If he is reelected, there appear to be few practical or legal barriers to Trump making good on his campaign promise.

Trump’s decisionmaking process is also highly adaptable, so the ultimate outcomes are less clear. He likes to throw out provocative ideas that grab attention but sometimes abandons or adapts them if there’s too much of a backlash. More than anything else, he is a dealmaker who uses provocative threats, including tariffs, for negotiating leverage and attention. Whether the tariff threats would become reality is anyone’s guess, but as China, U.S. trading partners, and foreign steel and aluminum makers found out in Trump’s first term, it would be foolish to write them off.

The results of the election are in: Donald Trump will be the 47th president of the United States. Trump’s win comes after a campaign in which he consistently targeted immigrants, transgender youth, and other vulnerable communities with hateful rhetoric. He also threatened retribution against dissidents and political opponents. I know that many of us fear what these results mean for our communities, our nation and ourselves. We know that a second Trump administration will be even more aggressive and effective than it was before — because Trump has repeatedly said so.

""Together, we are powerful enough to change the course of our nation’s history and defend our most fundamental rights and freedoms.""

As outlined in Project 2025, under a second Trump administration, our federal government will deport immigrants in dragnet raids, target his political adversaries, spy on private citizens, promote discrimination against marginalized communities, and control what we can and can’t do with our bodies. This dystopian view of American life threatens our fundamental freedoms. We know from prior experience that our fear is real. We also know that despair and resignation are not a strategy. At the ACLU, we’re choosing to channel our fear into action. Together, we are powerful enough to change the course of our nation’s history and defend our most fundamental rights and freedoms. That is why the ACLU has a concrete plan to fight back. When President-elect Trump comes for our communities, he’s gotta get through all of us. During Trump’s first term, the ACLU filed 434 legal challenges against his administration, successfully blocking some of Trump’s most egregious policies, like the Muslim ban and separating immigrant families. When Trump once again set his sights on the White House, the ACLU’s legal and advocacy experts drafted a roadmap to combat his administration head-on. On day one, we are prepared to:

Defend against the Trump administration’s unlawful mass deportation plan through coordinated action at all levels of government. We’ll also work with states and localities to protect residents to the full extent possible and ensure that a Trump administration can’t hijack state resources to carry out its draconian policies.

We’ll also work with states and localities to protect residents to the full extent possible and ensure that a Trump administration can’t hijack state resources to carry out its draconian policies. Provide legal defense to whistleblowers and critics who dare to stand up to Trump’s policies. We’ll also protect freedom of speech and the right to protest against Trump’s agenda.

We’ll also protect freedom of speech and the right to protest against Trump’s agenda. Use the courts to affirm that LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination under federal law. We’ll fight to invalidate Trump administration policies that permit discrimination across the federal government, and to shut down the administration’s efforts to require discrimination at the state and local levels.

We’ll fight to invalidate Trump administration policies that permit discrimination across the federal government, and to shut down the administration’s efforts to require discrimination at the state and local levels. Challenge the Trump administration’s dangerous attacks on reproductive freedom, including any attempts to weaponize the Comstock Act to ban abortion nationwide or to take medication abortion off the shelves. We’ll also protect access to birth control and family planning services.

As soon as the 119th Congress is sworn in, we will urge members to use their constitutional powers to provide oversight, investigate wrongdoing, and reject restrictive executive branch policies. At the state level, we’ll work with lawmakers to build a firewall for freedom and enact laws that protect people from government abuse. In our communities, we’re working to educate people on what is at risk, what happens next, and how we can fight for our freedoms together. This is my sixth presidential election as executive director at the ACLU and there is not a doubt in my mind that our organization is the best equipped to meet this moment. We have more than a century of experience in combating political repression, we have some of the nation’s best legal and political advocates, we have our nationwide network of ACLU affiliates, and we have all of you. The Trump administration’s anti-liberty and fundamentally anti-American policies will be met with the full firepower of the ACLU, the might of our allies, and the commitment of the American people. Above all else, that gives me hope. The next four years will be challenging, but we’re ready to put up the fight of the century. You can count on it.

BBC

Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an “unprecedented and powerful” mandate to govern. He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall. Trump’s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda. He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history. But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting. His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a ""landslide"" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues. ""It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,"" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos. The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House. That is thanks to America’s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states. Here are three ways to look at his win.

Trump missed majority of voters by a hair

With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC’s US partner, CBS News. That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004. But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California. This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.

In 2024, Trump’s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago. But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall. To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016. For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate ""may be overwrought"", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to ""justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government"".

His electoral college win was resounding

On a different metric, Trump’s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris’s 226. And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one. The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college. Trump’s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984. And it is important to remember that the “winner takes all” mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph. What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?

Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote. If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide. In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable. But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender. Republicans win House in major boost for Trump

'It's simple, really' - why Latinos voted for Trump

Second highest vote count - behind Biden in 2020

There is another measure with which to consider Trump’s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure. The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.

It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964. That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved. Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket. Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to ""2019 prices"" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze. ""The real story is Harris’s inability to mobilise people who voted for Biden in 2020,"" he said.",Just how big was Donald Trump’s election victory?

"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost - The Guardian,"It has been an extraordinary week for US politics – and a very depressing couple of days for those such as me who spent hours on the phone to people, trying to persuade them to vote for Kamala Harris and not Donald Trump. This is what voters told me time and again, and why so many did vote for Trump.

The first type of voter I encountered as a volunteer on the Harris phone bank was the one focused purely on the economy. It is hard for people on the European side of the Atlantic to grasp that soaring growth rates and low unemployment in the US would not be seen positively in the eyes of an American voter. But it was clear in my conversations that the Trump campaign was extremely effective at countering that story. Wages may well be rising at all levels, but everyday inflation was more discernible to voters.

Very often, I spoke to small business owners who would talk about the price of gas or bread, rendering any attempted explanation of global pressures responsible for that ineffective at best, and at worst condescending. Often, they would also tell me that everyone they knew was doing badly, even if they were just fine themselves. Was poor messaging to blame? That didn’t seem obvious. Democrats tried to tell the story of average wages being higher and unemployment being at an historic low, but people just seemed to believe Trump more often than they believed Harris and Tim Walz. There was no easy way to counter that, especially in a campaign lasting barely 100 days.

The next group was extremely focused on Harris as a candidate. She was as baggage-free as a vice-president could have been, and many voters spoke of how much they admired her. But there were too many others. Multiple times, I was told that Harris was a “communist”, “clueless” and that she had “thrown black men in jail for carrying one blunt”. One Latin American voter told me at length that she had “seen it all before in South America”.

Harris’s perceived failures on border security did come up too, but mainly the criticisms came straight from the mouth of the Trump campaign. Some spoke of Harris’s tough stance on crime as the district attorney of San Francisco. Others, very often of Latino origin, would tell me that she was soft on law and order. Quite remarkably, the Trump campaign successfully branded Harris as both a communist – lax on law and order – and simultaneously too tough on crime. To many, she was both an ineffective vice-president and one who had her hands all over the Biden administration. Voters held these facts in their heads at once – and would not be persuaded otherwise.

I started calling voters five weeks ago and especially then, many voters said they didn’t know who Harris was or what she stood for. It is said that an open primary process would have given Harris the chance to separate herself from Biden, but not a single person I spoke to suggested that they would have preferred a different candidate.

But gender did play a role. Time and again, voters, very often women themselves, told me that they just didn’t think that “America is ready for a female president”. People said they couldn’t “see her in the chair” and asked if I “really thought a woman could run the country”. One person memorably told me that she couldn’t vote for Harris because “you don’t see women building skyscrapers”. Sometimes, these people would be persuaded, but more often than not it was a red line. Many conversations would start with positive discussions on policy and then end on Harris and her gender. That is an extraordinary and uncomfortable truth.

You should know what I didn’t hear during the hours speaking to US voters. I can only think of one occasion when someone mentioned stricter taxes on billionaires or any similar policies. The atrocities being committed by Israel in Gaza only came up six times in more than 1,000 calls. The idea that Harris was not leftwing enough seems false: the majority of the country just voted for the complete opposite.

After all those conversations, I think the main reason that Harris and Walz lost this campaign is simple: Trump. Ultimately, he was simply too much of a pull again. Despite the gaffes, despite his views on women, despite his distaste for democracy and despite an insurrection, voters just didn’t care.

For reasons that I’m sure will be studied for decades, when he speaks, people listen. When he speaks, people believe him. After all those calls, I can be shocked at this result, but hardly surprised.",I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost  The Guardian,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/09/us-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump-republican
"Sun, 13 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,"Trump’s protests aside, his agenda has plenty of overlap with Project 2025 - The Associated Press","ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump insists that Project 2025, a nearly 1,000-page blueprint for a hard-right turn in American government and society, does not reflect his priorities for a White House encore.

“I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it — purposefully,” the Republican presidential nominee said Sept. 10 on the debate stage.

Yet from economics, immigration and education policy to civil rights and foreign affairs, there are common ideas and shared ideology between Project 2025 and Trump’s outline for another term — from his official “Agenda 47” slate, the Republican platform he personally approved and his other statements.

There are also differences: Project 2025, led by the Heritage Foundation and written by many conservatives who worked in or with Trump’s administration, offers more particulars on some issues than the former president.

Here’s a look at how Trump’s 2024 campaign and Project 2025 align and deviate:

Key tax proposals could benefit the wealthy

TRUMP: His tax policies lean broadly toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That’s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 overhaul while lowering the corporate rate to 15% from the current 21%. He also would end Inflation Reduction Act levies that are financing energy measures intended to combat climate change. Those ideas aside, Trump has put more emphasis on his plans aimed at working- and middle-class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security payments and overtime wages from income taxes. His proposal on tips, however, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some pay as tip income — a prospect that, at its most extreme, could see hedge-fund managers or top attorneys taking advantage of a provision Trump frames as an aid to restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.

PROJECT 2025: The document goes further than Trump, calling for two federal income tax rates — 15% and 30% — while eliminating most deductions and credits. It envisions a “nearly flat tax on wage income beyond the standard deduction” by adjusting what income is subjected to the payroll taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicare. An effectively flat tax federally would increase the overall share of taxes paid by poorer and middle-class Americans. That’s because many state and local tax codes, anchored by transactional taxes and flatter income taxes, are more regressive than current federal income tax brackets. Project 2025 also calls for requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise corporate or individual income taxes in the future.

Both want to reimpose Trump-era immigration limits

TRUMP: “Build the wall!” from 2016 has become creating “the largest mass deportation program in history.” Trump calls for enlisting National Guard and police, though he’s not said how he’d ensure they target only people in the U.S. illegally. He has pitched “ideological screening” for would-be entrants and ending birthright citizenship (which likely would require a constitutional change). He has also said he’d reinstitute first-term policies such as “Remain in Mexico,” limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. In full, his approach would not just crack down on illegal migration but also limit immigration altogether.

PROJECT 2025: There is a litany of detailed proposals for various U.S. immigration statutes, executive branch rules and agreements with other countries — reducing the number of refugees, work visa recipients and asylum seekers, for example. Perhaps the most instructive statement from Project 2025 is its call to reinstate “every rule related to immigration that was issued” during Trump’s 2017-2021 term.

Both would ramp up executive power and the authority to fire federal employees

TRUMP: He frames regulatory cuts as an economic cure-all. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households’ utility bills by removing speed bumps for fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration. (U.S. energy production and exports are at record highs under President Joe Biden.) Trump promises to boost housing stock by cutting regulations, though most construction rules come from state and local governments.

Two broad proposals and ideas stand out: The first would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands more of them as being outside civil service protections. That almost certainly would weaken the government’s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work. The second is Trump’s assertion that the president has exclusive power to control federal spending despite Congress’ appropriations power. Trump argues that lawmakers “set a ceiling” on spending but not a floor — meaning the president’s constitutional duty to “faithfully execute the laws” grants him discretion on whether to spend the money.

PROJECT 2025: The authors make scores of calls for the president, Cabinet and other political appointees to slash regulations, reclassify federal employees to make them easier to fire, reduce “unaccountable federal spending” and set a course from the West Wing. “The Administrative State is not going anywhere until Congress acts to retrieve its own power from bureaucrats and the White House,” they write. “In the meantime, there are many executive tools a courageous conservative president can use to handcuff the bureaucracy (and) bring the Administrative State to heel.”

Both would roll back DEI and LGBTQ programs

TRUMP: The former president wants to end government diversity programs, using federal funding as leverage, and he would target existing protections for LGBTQ individuals. On transgender rights, he promises to end “boys in girls’ sports,” a practice he insists, without evidence, is rampant. Trump would reverse Biden’s extension of Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students and ask Congress to allow only two gender choices at birth.

PROJECT 2025: Government should “affirm that children require and deserve both the love and nurturing of a mother and the play and protection of a father.” That philosophy permeates Project 2025, which defines the ideal family — and individual — in narrow, traditionalist terms. Authors envision consolidating federal civil rights efforts within the Justice Department’s civil rights division, with enforcement coming only through litigation. That effectively would concentrate the choice of how and when to enforce civil rights law with the attorney general — and, by extension, the White House.

Both would abolish the Department of Education

TRUMP: The Department of Education would be targeted for elimination. That does not mean Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. Among other maneuvers, he would use federal appropriations as leverage to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education and compel K-12 schools to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers. He calls for pulling money from “any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.”

Trump calls for redirecting universities’ endowment money into an online “ American Academy” offering college credentials to all Americans without charging tuition. “It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed,” Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.

PROJECT 2025: Congress should “shutter” the Department of Education and “return control of education to the states,” Project 2025 argues, echoing Trump’s argument that U.S. educational infrastructure imposes progressive indoctrination. The authors propose, among other things, eliminating the Head Start program, turning the Title I program into block grants and eventually phasing out that federal financing, and using the tax code to incentivize at-home child care, something GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance advocates.

Both blast climate policy

TRUMP: Trump claims falsely that climate change is a “hoax” as he disparages Biden spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. Trump would anchor energy and transportation policy to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end incentives that encourage EV-market development. And he would lower fuel efficiency standards.

PROJECT 2025: The document criticizes the Biden administration’s “climate fanaticism.” It proposes closing or limiting many programs for environmental protection and regulation, including those many Americans take for granted. Among them: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which Project 2025 would eliminate, and the National Weather Service, which the document would steer toward exclusively selling weather data to private forecasters. It would leave the National Hurricane Center in place — though NHC depends on the National Weather Service to make forecasts. The plan would not repeal laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, but its regulatory and bureaucracy cuts would reduce their reach.

Project 2025 backs Ukraine’s defense, while Trump has questioned US support

TRUMP: His strategy is more isolationist diplomatically, noninterventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. Trump pledges military expansion, promises robust Pentagon spending and proposes a missile defense shield — an idea from the Reagan era. He insists he can end Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel-Hamas fighting, though he has not explained how. He remains openly critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. “I don’t consider them leaders,” he says. And he repeatedly praises authoritarians like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.

PROJECT 2025: Echoing Trump’s vibe, the document calls for “tough love” in international relations — but with distinctions from Trump. On military preparedness, Project 2025 would curtail the number of generals but expand the number of enlisted personnel, though the authors do not call for reinstituting a draft, as critics have alleged. Project 2025 is perhaps even more aggressive than Trump in its China rhetoric: “Economic engagement with China should be ended, not rethought,” the foreword states.

On NATO, the blueprint echoes Trump’s emphasis on other member nations paying more for their own defense, but it does not carry the inherent skepticism of NATO alliances that Trump has projected for years. And while Trump steadfastly refuses to criticize Putin for invading Ukraine, Project 2025 states: “Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland.”","Trump’s protests aside, his agenda has plenty of overlap with Project 2025  The Associated Press",The Associated Press,https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation-e2b1be71422f4afcfd4a397828f7cab6
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Election takeaways: Trump’s decisive victory in a deeply divided nation - The Associated Press,"Follow AP’s coverage of Donald Trump’s transition back to the White House.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump scored a decisive victory in a deeply divided nation. And in so doing, the Republican president-elect exposed a fundamental weakness within the Democratic base and beat back concerns about his moral failings, becoming the first U.S. president with a felony conviction.

Trump won over frustrated voters with bold promises that his fiery brand of America-first economic populism and conservative culture would make their lives better. He will be tested immediately, however, and there are reasons to believe his plans for mass deportations and huge tariffs may hurt the very people who enabled his victory.

Still, he is set to enter the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, from an undisputed position of strength. With votes still being counted, he could become the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote.

The results left Democrats facing an urgent and immediate reckoning, with no obvious leader to unite the anti-Trump coalition and no clear plan to rebuild as an emboldened Trump prepares to re-take Washington.

Here are some key takeaways:

With modest shifts, Trump undermines the Democrats’ coalition

Black voters — men and women — have been the bedrock of the Democratic Party, and in recent years, Latinos and young voters have joined them.

All three groups still preferred Democrat Kamala Harris. But preliminary data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide, suggested that Trump made significant gains.

Voters under age 30 represent a fraction of the total electorate, but about half of them supported Harris. That’s compared to the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Slightly more than 4 in 10 young voters went for Trump, up from about one-third in 2020.

At the same time, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to AP VoteCast.

About 8 in 10 Black voters backed Harris, down from the roughly 9 in 10 who backed Biden. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump’s support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020. Collectively, those small gains yielded an outsize outcome.

Trump focus on immigration, economy and culture worked

For all of the showmanship, profanity and name-calling, Trump ultimately won over voters with grand promises to improve the economy, block the flow of immigrants on the Southern border and his siren call to “make America great again.”

He also appealed to religious voters in both parties by seizing on the Democrats’ support for the transgender community.

Overall, about half of Trump voters said inflation was the biggest issue factoring into their election decisions. About as many said that of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to AP VoteCast.

He papered over the fact that the economy by many conventional metrics is robust — inflation is largely in check and wages are up — while border crossings have dropped dramatically. He talked right past the facts and through relentless repetition convinced voters.

He also sold them on the promise of the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history, although he has not explained how such an operation would work. And he is threatening to impose massive tariffs on key products from China and other American adversaries, which economists warn could dramatically boost prices for average Americans.

Ultimately, Trump’s victory may have had as much to do with the fundamental challenges Harris faced all along. Facing deep voter frustration over the direction of the country — with Biden’s approval rating dismal — she never did distance herself from her party’s sitting president. Though Trump has now been the central figure in American politics for nine years, he convinced voters he represented change.

Trump will take charge of a nation with deep fissures

Trump is poised to inherit a nation with deepening political and cultural fissures and a worried electorate.

When asked what most influenced their vote, about half of voters cited the future of democracy. That was higher than the share who answered the same way about inflation, immigration or abortion policy. And it crosses over the two major parties: About two-thirds of Harris voters and about a third of Trump voters said the future of democracy was the most important factor in their votes.

That’s not surprising given the realities of the Trump era and the rhetoric of the campaign.

Trump refused to acknowledge his 2020 defeat and watched his supporters ransack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress convened to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. Trump even mused two days before Election Day that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after repeatedly promising retribution to his political enemies.

Harris, by the end of the campaign, joined other critics — including Trump’s former White House chief of staff — in describing the former president and now president-elect as a “fascist.” Trump, meanwhile, labeled Harris a “fascist” and a “communist.”

Trump’s criminal baggage not an issue for many voters

Incomplete returns show that Donald Trump’s criminal convictions, additional pending indictments and any concerns over his most incendiary rhetoric simply were not a sufficient concern to keep tens of millions of Americans from voting for him.

According to AP VoteCast, slightly more than half of voters said Harris has the moral character to be president, compared to about 4 in 10 who said that about Trump. It’s quite possible, as Trump has said many times on the campaign trail, that his legal peril actually helped him.

As it stands, Trump may never actually face sentencing in a New York business fraud case in which he was convicted of 34 felonies. For now, his sentencing is scheduled for later this month.

He’s already had one federal indictment in Florida dismissed, sparing him from a trial on whether he flouted U.S. law on protecting national security secrets. And he’s made clear he would use his power as president to spike the federal case against him for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. That would leave a Georgia racketeering case pending against Trump and others accused of trying to subvert the 2020 election result.

‘Bro’ politics beats out abortion concerns

It was the first presidential election after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a woman’s national right to terminate a pregnancy. It was also the first time that a Republican presidential candidate overly courted males with a hypermasculine approach.

But the “gender gap” that resulted was not enough to sink Trump.

About half of women backed Harris, while about half of men went for Trump, according to AP VoteCast. That appears largely consistent with the shares for Biden and Trump in 2020.

Democrats face leadership crisis with urgent need to regroup

Just a few months ago, Harris generated incredible excitement across the party. She raised more than a billion dollars seemingly overnight. She dominated her debate with Trump. She filled arenas. And just days ago drew a massive crowd to the Ellipse and National Mall.

But in the end, it wasn’t enough.

Meanwhile, Republicans have claimed control of the Senate, ousting veteran Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and putting several other Democratic incumbents on the edge of defeat. The results will give Trump a significant advantage in pushing his agenda through Congress. Their only hope is to win a House majority built mostly through key suburban districts in California and New York, but that was far from certain early Wednesday.

And either way, the results shrink Democrats’ geographic footprint and, with Brown’s loss, diminish the kind of working class voice that can counter Trump’s appeal.

Trump already succeeded in painting Democrats as out-of-touch culturally with middle America. Now Democrats are left to wonder how to reconnect with parts of the country and slices of the electorate that rejected them.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,How Donald Trump won the presidency - ABC News,"Former President Donald Trump is projected to be the next president of the United States, according to an ABC News projection issued at 5:31 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Nov. 6. As of 6 a.m. Eastern, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had been projected for Trump, and the once-and-future president leads in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada as well. At this point, the most likely final outcome appears to be a 312-226 Trump victory. Plus, while it will take some time to count all the ballots, Trump looks likely to win the national popular vote for president, too.

Over the next few months, we at 538 will do a lot of analysis to figure out how exactly Trump won. He may be, after all, only the second Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to win the national popular vote. That warrants not only introspection among Democrats, but a lot of quality analysis, too. And Trump's sweep of the swing states — while not surprising — also represents a new high-water mark for his electoral success.

For now, though, here are three quick possible explanations for Trump's victory tonight. These insights draw primarily on the exit poll, which for various reasons is imperfect but for now remains the best source of available data on why and how different types of people voted. (We reserve the right to revisit these conclusions when more data is available.)

Inflation

For all the hubbub about various issues, statements, rallies and rhetoric during this election, the economy is unique as providing the most obvious gravitational pull toward Trump. Voters rank the cost of living in America as one of their top concerns — and no doubt it is one of the most pressing, salient and visible problems in their lives. It is not a stretch of the imagination to imagine they would punish the incumbent party for this regardless of how unfavorably they viewed Trump; in fact that is what voters have been doing all around the world over the past three years.

According to the exit poll, 35 percent of voters nationally rated the ""state of democracy"" as the most important factor to their vote. Eighty-one percent of these people voted for Harris and just 17 percent for Trump. But the economy was the next-most-influential issue. Among these voters, Trump led 79 percent to 20 percent. In the end, abortion did not rate as highly as Democrats might have hoped; only 14 percent rated it as their biggest concern.

It's possible that inflation contributed to the growing divide between high-income voters and low-income voters. According to the exit poll, Democrats increased their vote share by 9 points among voters living in households that make more than $100,000 dollars a year. Among households making less, which account for about 60 percent of voters, Republicans gained 12 points on margin.

Racial polarization

Initial exit poll estimates also suggest Democratic support declined among non-white voters and rose among white voters (especially college-educated ones). The exit poll indicates Trump won white voters by 12 percentage points, 55 percent to Harris's 43 percent. Compared to the 2020 exit poll, that is a 5-point improvement for Democrats.

Democrats performed best relative to 2020 among white college-educated voters. They moved 7 points to the left, voting 54 percent to 44 percent for Harris. Non-white non-college-educated voters, meanwhile, moved 13 points toward Trump.

The Republican's gains with nonwhites was particularly acute among Hispanic and Latino voters. Democrats' vote margin with the group fell by 26 points, according to the exit poll, to just a 53-percent-to-45-percent margin. Trump's vote share with Latinos looks like it could be the best since George W. Bush's 44 percent in 2004. Latino men moved 33 points toward Trump, one of his biggest swings.

Democratic turnout was poor

In addition to economic headwinds and deteriorating margins with their base, it looks like Democrats also simply had bad turnout. So far, around 137 million ballots have been counted for the 2024 presidential race. Predictions of final turnout are hovering somewhere in the neighborhood 152 million votes. That would be a decrease from the 158 million who voted in 2020 and would be equivalent to about 61 percent of eligible voters. That would be a decline from 66 percent in 2020.

It is also likely that the drop in turnout disproportionately affected Democrats. While we can't be sure until we can review records of who actually voted (states will release those over the next few months), the drop-off in turnout is currently greater in the most Democratic counties across the battleground states. That is something that would uniquely hurt Harris; if you're a Democrat, then lower turnout in the suburbs is bad, of course, but not so bad as missing the mark in Philadelphia or Milwaukee, where you're relying on a lot of votes to carry you to victory.

Over the next few months, we'll be able to pore over even more data about why Trump won (again). The basic explanation is that this was always going to be a hard election for Harris to win. She both failed to persuade swing voters and to get out her base where it mattered most. Democrats will have to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out how to recover.",How Donald Trump won the presidency  ABC News,ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/538/donald-trump-won-presidency/story?id=115556511

Long before they even knew what the White House was... Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are pictured above both aged three. Decades apart, Democratic presidential nominee Harris spent her early years in Oakland, California, and Republican nominee Trump was raised in the New York borough of Queens.

Harris (left in the left-hand image below) and her sister Maya (centre) were primarily brought up by their Indian mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and social activist. Trump's father Fred Trump was the son of German immigrants and his mother Mary Anne MacLeod Trump was born in Scotland. They enrolled him in the New York Military Academy at age 13.

Harris spent five years at high school in Montreal, Canada, where her mother took up a teaching job at McGill University. She later enrolled in the historically black college, Howard University in Washington DC.

Trump has said his five years at the academy, which began in 1959, gave him military training and helped shape his leadership skills. He later sat out the Vietnam War due to deferments - four for academic reasons and one due to bone spurs.

From an early age, Harris was taught by her mother the importance of the civil rights movement and she attended the annual Martin Luther King Jr Freedom March in Washington in 2004. After earning a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Trump became favoured to succeed his father at the helm of the family business.

Harris returned to California, where she rose swiftly to the top of the state's criminal justice system - taking a job as its attorney general - and used that momentum to mount a successful run for the US Senate in 2016.

At the same time as she entered Congress, Trump was stepping into the White House for the first time, having stunned the world to defeat Hillary Clinton. Three years later Harris ran a lacklustre presidential campaign, but was picked by the victor of the Democratic race, Joe Biden, to be his running mate. They proved to be the winning ticket, defeating Trump and Mike Pence.

The end of the Trump presidency and the start of the Biden-Harris term were marked by Covid lockdowns, mask mandates and social unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Harris struggled at times to make her mark as vice-president, but found her voice in 2022 when the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion. President Biden was happy for her to become the White House champion for the pro-choice movement. It was Trump who had made the Supreme Court more conservative, paving the way for the abortion ruling. During his time in the Oval Office, he also took the US out of the Paris climate accord and took steps to reduce immigration.

Harris's debut international visit as vice-president was to Guatemala in 2021, as part of the responsibility she was given to reduce the numbers of Latin American migrants reaching America's southern border with Mexico. Foreign policy issues that have dominated her time in office include the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump's first visit overseas as president was to Saudi Arabia in 2017. Trump advocates isolationist policies that involve disentangling his country from foreign conflicts and promoting American industry.

Harris is married to Doug Emhoff (pictured below), who campaigns regularly on her behalf. She is stepmother - or ""Momala"", as she says - to Emhoff's children from his first marriage, Cole (left) and Ella (right). Various members of Donald Trump's family have played roles in his political career, though appearances in the 2024 campaign by his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump, have been limited. With his first wife, Ivana, Trump had three children: Donald Jr (second left in the lower picture), Ivanka (second right) and Eric (right). He had a daughter, Tiffany (left), with his second wife, Marla Maples. He married his third wife Melania (third left) in 2005, with whom he has one son, Barron.

Harris entered the 2024 presidential race relatively late in the process, replacing Joe Biden who pulled out. She made history as the first black and Asian-American woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket, and went on to give a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. In the same election, Donald Trump earned the rare distinction of earning a third presidential nomination from his party.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,How Trump Will Change the World - Foreign Affairs Magazine,"A gray rhino—a predictable and long-foreseen disruption that is still shocking when it occurs—has crashed into American foreign policy: Donald Trump has won a second term as president of the United States. Despite polls predicting a nail-biter, the final results were fairly decisive, and although we do not know the precise composition of the new order, we know Trump will be at the top of it.

Trump’s win in 2016 was far more of a surprise, and much of the debate in the weeks after Election Day revolved around the questions of how he would govern and how dramatically he might seek to alter the United States’ role in the world. Owing to Trump’s unpredictability, erratic style, and less-than-coherent thinking, some of those same questions remain open today. But we have far more information now after four years of watching him lead, four more years of analyzing his time in office, and a year of witnessing his third campaign for the White House. With that data, it’s possible to make some predictions about what Trump will try to do in his second term. The known unknown is how the rest of the world will react and what the ultimate outcome will be.

Two main things are clear. First, as in Trump’s first term (and as in all presidential administrations), personnel will shape policy, and various factions will jockey for influence—some with radical ideas about transforming the administrative state and American foreign policy, others with more conventional views. This time around, however, the more extreme factions will have the upper hand, and they will press their advantage to ice out more moderate voices, hollow out the ranks of civilian and military professionals they see as “the deep state,” and perhaps use the levers of government to go after Trump’s opponents and critics.

Second, the essence of Trump’s approach to foreign policy—naked transactionalism—remains unchanged. But the context in which he will try to carry out his idiosyncratic form of dealmaking has changed dramatically: the world today is a far more dangerous place than it was during his first term. Trump’s campaign rhetoric painted the world in apocalyptic terms, portraying himself and his team as hard-nosed realists who understood the danger. But what they offered was less realism than magical realism: a set of fanciful boasts and shallow nostrums that reflected no genuine understanding of the threats the United States faces. Whether Trump can in fact protect American interests in this complex environment may depend on how quickly he and his team jettison the campaign caricature that persuaded a little more than half the electorate and instead confront the world as it really is.

THE PERSONNEL IS POLITICAL

The first task Trump faces will be the formal transition. Even under the best of circumstances, this is a difficult bureaucratic maneuver to execute, and it is doubtful it will go smoothly this time. Trump has already registered his disdain for the process and, to avoid being subject to stringent ethical constraints, has refused so far to cooperate with the General Services Administration, which provides the infrastructure that allows a government in waiting to garner the information it needs to be ready on day one. The absence of a traditional transition may not slow the incoming administration down all that much, however, since it already outsourced most of the work to the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 and the less well-known transition project of the America First Institute. The work done by MAGA true believers on those projects is far more consequential and more indicative of what an incoming Trump administration will do than anything developed by the nominal transition effort co-chaired by former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

The transition will be even less consequential if the Trump team follows through on its plans to forgo FBI background checks and instead have the president grant security clearances solely on the basis of internal campaign vetting, allowing Trump to prevent his preferred personnel choices from being blocked by any skeletons in their closets. Such a radical step would probably be legal, but only after Trump is inaugurated. In the meantime, the outgoing Biden administration would be limited in its ability to coordinate with the incoming Trump team in the traditional way because Trump’s staffers would not have clearances.

This will matter even more if Trump decides to put into senior positions some of the fringe characters who now dominate his inner circle. Even if Trump does not carry out the wildest notions he floated during the campaign—the retired football star and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker will not be in charge of missile defense, for instance—he might bring in to national security posts individuals such as the retired general Michael Flynn or Steve Bannon, whose brushes with the law would normally block them from service in the national security state. Either way, he will arrive with a team determined to carry out many of the same schemes that less radical figures managed to talk Trump out of pursuing in his first term. For instance, after losing the 2020 election, Trump wanted to impose a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in his waning weeks as commander in chief: the same kind of disastrous retreat that President Joe Biden authorized a half year later. But when some on his remaining national security team pointed out the risks of this maneuver, Trump relented.

In Trump’s second term, the more extreme factions of his administration will have the upper hand.

During his first term, Trump’s national security political appointees could be placed in one of three categories. The first and perhaps largest one consisted of people with genuine expertise who might have gotten positions in a normal Republican administration, albeit probably a couple of levels below the ones they came to occupy in Trumpworld. They tried to implement the president’s agenda as best they could amid the chaos, and most of the good things that happened can be credited to them: for example, the effort to turn former President Barack Obama’s rhetorical “pivot to Asia” into a reality with meaningful strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region mostly happened below Trump’s radar and continued along similar tracks in the Biden administration, advanced by like-minded strategists.

A smaller but vastly more influential group was made up of veteran senior officials who had fixed ideas about where national security policy should go and believed they could engineer those outcomes despite Trump’s hypertransactionalism by emphasizing how the alternative policy would signal weakness. Examples include H. R. McMaster and John Bolton, who served as Trump’s second and third national security advisers, respectively. In their memoirs, they point to what they considered to be genuine policy achievements: McMaster got Trump to agree to a surge of U.S. troops into Afghanistan in 2017 and Bolton got Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. But McMaster, Bolton, and every other senior figure who took that approach wound up leaving the administration after recognizing that Trump would always find a way to slip loose from the harness and bolt, undercutting whatever policy good they otherwise thought they might achieve. Even some of those who made it to Biden’s inauguration in 2021 without quitting have offered me remarkably candid assessments in private that confirm the picture of Trump as reckless and anything but a national security mastermind, regardless of what they have said publicly.

The third category was a small but influential group of MAGA true believers and chaos agents who sought to carry out Trump’s whims without any clarification or regard for the consequences. They had a cramped view of loyalty, believing that the boss should get what he appeared to ask for and not hear about the unintended consequences of those moves lest he change his mind when fully apprised of the facts. For instance, the risky attempts to retreat from Afghanistan and other NATO commitments in the waning days of the first term were engineered by junior staffers who were left in charge after more senior leaders had cleared out and who sought to prevent Trump from being fully advised on what his directives would actually yield.

In the coming Trump administration, there will still be the conventional Republicans seeking a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity and willing to risk the self-immolation that might befall them if they somehow run afoul of Trump. No one should denigrate their service, since without them, Trump will not be the best president he can be. There will still be the ideologues who think they know the right strategy to follow and believe they can channel Trump into doing what they consider to be the right thing—for example, abandoning Ukraine to the predations of Russian President Vladimir Putin while stiffening U.S. deterrence of China, an approach that might seem clever in an academic seminar or a newspaper op-ed but likely will not work in real life. And thanks to the Heritage Foundation and the America First Institute, there will be plenty of chaos agents for whom destroying the existing system of national security policymaking, which has preserved American interests for 80 years, will be a feature of Trump 2.0, not a bug. The difference is that this time, the third group will be larger and more influential than last time.

The essence of Trump’s approach to foreign policy—naked transactionalism—remains unchanged.

This poses a serious challenge to the custodians of the existing system of national security policymaking: the uniformed military and the civil service that make up the vast majority of people tasked with overseeing any president’s agenda. Trump and his team have made it clear that they prioritize loyalty above all. And they may have the simplest of loyalty tests: ask any individual in a position of authority whether the election of 2020 was stolen or whether the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol was an act of insurrection. As Trump’s running mate JD Vance has demonstrated, there is only one way to answer those questions that Trump will accept.

A litmus test like that could allow Trump to politicize the senior ranks of the military and the intelligence services by promoting only individuals he believes are “on the team.” Members of the civil service would enjoy more job security and insulation from political pressure, unless the Trump team pursues its plan to reclassify thousands of professional civil servants as political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president, thus making them relatively easy to remove for political reasons.

The military and the civil service are unlikely to take any provocative action that would trigger, let alone justify, such a purge. They understand that they are not the “loyal opposition”—a role reserved for the minority party in Congress and watchdogs in the media and the policy commentariat. In accordance with their oaths of service and their professional ethic, professionals in the national security state will be preparing themselves to help Trump as best they can.

But Trump may decide he can get the cooperation or capitulation he seeks simply by leaving the threat of a purge hanging in the air—and he would be right. At a minimum, he is likely to fire some senior figures, in an echo of Voltaire’s advice to eliminate some French generals to strike fear into the hearts of others. The question is whether high-level career officials will follow the best practices of civil-military relations and give their candid advice to Trump and his senior political appointees even when that advice is unwanted. If they do, they can help him be the best commander in chief he is capable of being. If they do not, it may not matter whether they are purged or kept in place, since they will not be effective either way.

ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES

American voters made their choice, and the machine of government in Washington will now accommodate itself to Trump one way or another. But what about the rest of the world? Most U.S. allies viewed a Trump victory with dread, believing that it would be a decisive nail in the coffin of America’s traditional global leadership. There is plenty to criticize about American foreign policy since World War II, and U.S. allies never tired of airing their complaints. But they also understood that the postwar era was vastly better for them than the era that preceded it, during which Washington shirked its responsibilities—and millions paid the ultimate price as a result.

When the American electorate chose Trump the first time, U.S. allies reacted with a variety of hedging strategies. This time around, they are in a much weaker position owing to their own internal challenges and to the threats posed by Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. U.S. allies will attempt to flatter and appease Trump and, to the extent that their laws allow them, offer him the blandishments and emoluments that proved the best way to get favorable terms during Trump 1.0. Trump’s transactional, short-term approach will likely produce a mirror image among the allies, who will seek to get what they can and avoid giving anything in return—a form of diplomacy that at best produces faux cooperation and at worst lets problems fester.

By contrast, among U.S. adversaries, Trump’s return will present abundant opportunities. Trump has promised to try to force Ukraine into conceding territory to Russia, solidifying Putin’s gains from the invasion. Unlike many campaign promises, this one is believable, because Trump has surrounded himself with anti-Ukraine and pro-Putin advisers. His plan for Ukraine is also likely to be implemented since it falls entirely within the range of presidential prerogative. The only question is whether Putin will accept a partial surrender with the understanding that he can always grab the rest of Ukraine’s territory once Trump has successfully imposed “neutrality” on Kyiv or whether Putin will call Trump’s bluff and demand full capitulation immediately.

The benefits for China are less obvious, since several of Trump’s key advisers indulge in the magical realism of thinking that the United States can sacrifice its interests in Europe while somehow also shoring up deterrence against Chinese predations in East Asia. The initial steps the new Trump administration takes in Asia might look hawkish at first glance. For instance, if Trump can put in place the massive tariffs he has proposed levying on Chinese goods, China’s economy might experience some pain, although the pain to U.S. consumers would be greater and more immediate. And Trump would likely look for a way to flex U.S. military might in Asia to signal a break with what he has depicted as Biden’s weakness.

Among U.S. adversaries, Trump’s return will present abundant opportunities.

But it is doubtful the tariffs would meaningfully change China’s policies or that performative hawkishness would translate into a sustained military buildup in Asia. For one thing, Trump has imposed certain conditions on defending Taiwan, demanding that Taipei quadruple its defense spending to qualify for stronger American support. This fanciful strategy could well collapse from its own contradictions, and it is possible that the Chinese-Russian partnership would find itself with the prospects of American retreat in both major theaters.

During the campaign, Trump and Vance cast themselves as men of peace while deriding their opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her allies as warmongers. Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s most loyal advisers, provided a vivid picture of the alleged choice. “This isn’t complicated,” he posted on the social media platform X. “If you vote for Kamala, Liz Cheney becomes defense secretary. We invade a dozen countries. Boys in Michigan are drafted to fight boys in the Middle East. Millions die. We invade Russia. We invade nations in Asia. World War III. Nuclear winter.”

This implied portrait of Trump as a cautious dove should be jarring to anyone who remembers his first-term threats to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea or his risky assassination of a top Iranian general. The undiluted isolationism of his campaign messaging could prove to be a straitjacket that paralyzes the Trump administration’s foreign policy at a critical time. But Trump famously wriggles free from such fetters and resists being hemmed in. As McMaster describes in his memoir, Trump’s savvier aides would use this to their advantage, casting whatever they wanted him to do as the very thing that his enemies said he could not do. That gambit would work in limited ways for a little while, but at some point, Trump would inevitably move in a completely different direction. This time around, that impulsivity might wind up thwarting, rather than empowering, the more extreme factions on his team.

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,"What Trump’s election win could mean for AI, climate and health - Nature.com","From repealing climate policies to overturning guidance on the safe development of artificial intelligence (AI), Republican Donald Trump made plenty of promises during his presidential campaign that could affect scientists and science policy. But fulfilling all his pledges won’t be easy.

The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?

Trump, now the US president-elect for a second time, will have some advantages as he re-enters the White House in January. The first time he took office, in 2017, his victory was a surprise, and many government watchers who spoke to Nature say he didn’t have a solid plan. By contrast, the Trump administration that enters office next year will be better prepared, and Trump himself is likely to face fewer checks on his power now that he has consolidated control over the Republican establishment, says Matt Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University in Washington DC who studies the evolution of the modern conservative movement.

But that doesn’t mean he will be able to do as he pleases, Dallek adds. “There’s a kind of revolutionary sweep to a lot of Trump’s promises that may collide with the messy reality of implementation.”

Here Nature talks to specialists on policy and other subjects about what might be in store on a range of science issues during a second Trump administration.

Artificial intelligence

Trump, who is industry-friendly, has promised to repeal US President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI, a guideline released last year for developing the technology safely and responsibly. Trump’s pledge echoes the Republican party’s platform, which says that the executive order “hinders AI Innovation”.

Given that executive orders can be revoked by a president at any time, it will be possible for Trump to implement his plan as soon as he enters the White House. But what will he put in its place?

‘We need to be ready for a new world’: scientists globally react to Trump election win

“The emphasis will shift away from the regulatory environment” and towards technology companies making their own voluntary decisions on safety, says Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination, and Redesign at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Venkatasubramanian says he is “sceptical that that will be enough” to address AI-associated risks to public safety, data-privacy concerns and the use of biased algorithms that disadvantage certain groups of people.

Biden’s executive order emphasized the need to ensure that AI models, which are trained on human-derived data, don’t output discriminatory results. That’s probably also not going to be a heavy priority for the new administration, Venkatasubramanian says. The Republican platform says that it will “support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing”.

According to Roman Yampolskiy, a computer scientist and AI-safety researcher at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, “it is a great idea to remove censorship and support free speech” in general. But, he says, “removing regulations around training of advanced AI systems is the worst possible thing we can do for the safety of the American people and the world”. Given the risks associated with developing superintelligent AI systems, which could potentially operate in unpredictable ways and cause harm to humans, Yampolskiy and other AI researchers have been arguing for a pause in AI development, which could be achieved only with stronger regulation.

Climate change

Many federal climate efforts are likely to stall or move in reverse under Trump, who has long denied the dangers of climate change while prioritizing the economic benefits of boosting domestic fossil-fuel production. Even so, policy specialists say that Trump is unlikely to stop the United States’s gradual shift towards clean energy.

The US election is monumental for science, say Nature readers — here’s why

For instance, it will not be easy to undo Biden’s signature climate achievement: the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which created a raft of federal investments, now estimated at more than US$1 trillion, in climate and clean energy that are scheduled to run until around 2032. Repealing that legislation would require an act of the US Congress. But even if Republicans end up in control of both congressional chambers, businesses and leaders in conservative US states that are already benefiting from IRA investments might not be eager to cut off the flow of federal money, says Joanna Lewis, who heads the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

Trump could have a bigger — and more negative — impact on climate progress if he moves to weaken climate regulations put in place for technologies such as power plants and automobiles. Similarly, his promise to put new tariffs on goods from countries such as China and Mexico could actually increase the cost of clean-energy technologies, says David Victor, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego.

The president-elect has also promised to once again pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement, which commits member countries to limiting global warming to 1.5–2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Trump’s administration had to wait until 2020 before formally leaving the agreement last time, and Biden moved to rejoin the agreement soon after taking office several months later. But under the rules of the agreement, the leaving process would take only one year this time around.

Many climate observers say the absence of the United States — the world’s second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter — from the pact could reduce pressure on China and other nations to scale up their efforts to curb emissions just as time is running short. “This is a pivotal decade for climate action, and four more years of Trump could be disastrous in terms of mobilizing climate action,” Lewis says.

Health

In the weeks leading up to the US election, Trump teamed up with political figure Robert F. Kennedy Jr on a platform promising to “make America healthy again” by tackling the root causes of chronic diseases, removing toxic substances from the environment and combating corporate corruption. Trump has said that he will let Kennedy, who has questioned vaccine safety, “go wild on” health, unnerving public-health and health-policy researchers.

It remains to be seen whether Trump will appoint Kennedy to a position such as director of US Health and Human Services (HHS) — or whether the US Senate would approve such a move — but it’s clear that Kennedy will have Trump’s ear on health issues.

Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association in Washington DC, worries about Kennedy’s role in the new administration because Kennedy has long cast doubt on the vaccine-approval process, threatening to undermine confidence in the jabs and cause a resurgence in illnesses such as measles. “People will get sick and die because of the confusion around vaccines, if [Kennedy and Trump] implement some of the things they verbalize,” he says.

Some of Kennedy’s goals, such as cracking down on ties to industry at regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration, are good, says Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a non-profit think tank in Washington DC. But those goals don’t jibe with what occurred during the first Trump administration, when Trump installed people in important health posts who had close industry ties, such as former HHS director Alex Azar, so it’s hard to know what will happen, she says.

Considering Trump’s isolationalist approach and his past comments criticizing the World Health Organization, support for global health is also likely to be “greatly scaled back” during Trump’s second term, says Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and long-time observer of the US biomedical funding landscape at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The United States is “the key player” in the funding of global-health initiatives, says Emanuel. This includes, for instance, a programme that aims to end the global AIDS epidemic. So it’s “hard to be optimistic” about the future, he adds.

Foreign science partnerships

During Trump’s first term, his administration barred people from about half a dozen countries that it said were “compromised by terrorism” from entering the United States and implemented an anti-espionage programme called the China Initiative that led to the arrests of a number of scientists of Chinese heritage. Although the Biden administration overturned the travel ban and ended the China Initiative, federal officials have continued efforts to guard against foreign interference in US research.

US election debate: what Harris and Trump said about science

Specialists say it’s unclear whether the second Trump administration will revive the China Initiative, although the Republican-led US House of Representatives advanced legislation in September that would do so. But a reinstatement of the travel ban is likely, says Adam Cohen, a lawyer at Siskind Susser in Memphis, Tennessee, who focuses on academic immigration and who says the president has broad authority to institute such policies.

Like the first Trump administration, the new one will probably clamp down on granting visas to foreign researchers and students from some countries, says Jennifer Steele, an education-policy researcher at American University in Washington DC. Policies that make it harder for international and US researchers to meet would also make it harder for new scientific collaborations to arise, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science, technology and international affairs at the Ohio State University in Columbus. That’s because such partnerships are fuelled by face-to-face contact. “Collaborations don’t begin with people just e-mailing each other across the miles,” she says.

But there might be one bright spot on the collaboration front, at least for US–China partnerships. Denis Simon, a non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign-policy think tank in Washington DC, thinks that a crucial pact governing US–China scientific cooperation that has been expired for the past year is likely to be signed by the Biden administration before Trump’s second inauguration in January. Although a renewed agreement would probably be more limited in scope owing to increased US–China tensions, its existence would show that “both governments give their blessing” to collaborations, Simon says.","What Trump’s election win could mean for AI, climate and health  Nature.com",Nature.com,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03667-w
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,"Donald Trump wins election in historic comeback after 2020 loss, indictments and bruising campaign - CBS News","Trump's political comeback and what could come next

Donald J. Trump's projected victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election marks a historic and improbable comeback for the former president, who left office in 2021 after failing to overturn the 2020 election results. Afterward, he became the first former president to be charged with either state or federal crimes, with four separate indictments, one of which resulted in conviction.

""We overcame obstacles that nobody ever thought we could,"" he said on election night after a bitter, bruising campaign. He vowed to fight for every family and for their futures. ""This will truly be the golden age of America,"" he vowed.

Trump was projected by CBS News to have won the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — surpassing the electoral vote threshold of 270 by 21 votes with a total of 291. Votes were still being counted in the other battleground states of Nevada and Arizona.

Exit polling shows Trump won overwhelmingly among White voters without a college education and made inroads with Black and Latino men.

Throughout his two-year campaign, Trump hammered President Biden, and later Harris, on inflation and the economy. It's a message that resonated with voters, whose views on the economy are more negative now than they were in 2020, despite the pandemic that brought the economy to a halt during his presidency. Nationally and across the battleground states, on the question of whether voters are better off now than they were four years ago, more voters said they are financially worse off.

In Georgia, independent voters broke for Trump in Georgia, 54% to 43%, according to CBS News exit polls. This is a group that backed Mr. Biden in 2020 by 9 points. The economy was their top issue.

Harris and Trump attracted equal support from independents in North Carolina, but that meant the vice president was winning a smaller share than Mr. Biden did in 2020. Even with that edge, North Carolina was the lone battleground state Trump won that year.

Trump also ran hard on immigration — as he has for nearly a decade — and vowed at nearly every campaign event that he'd carry out mass deportations if he's reelected. Exit polling showed that voters also believed Trump would do a better job of confronting illegal immigration at the southern border.

Trump has had an unshakeable base of voters, and in this election, he was able to attract new voters who were undecided — low-propensity, young male voters — turned out for him.

Trump is the first convicted felon to win the presidency. Sentencing for his federal conviction in the New York ""hush money"" trial is set for Nov. 26 and raises questions about how a president-elect would be punished under the law. He also faces criminal charges in three other cases whose futures are now in doubt.

At 78, Trump is the oldest person to be elected president — breaking the record held by President Biden, who withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July amid questions about his age and competency. Mr. Biden was also 78 when he took office in 2021, but on Inauguration Day, Trump will be several months older than Mr. Biden was when he was sworn in.

On his path to the presidency, Trump also survived two assassination attempts, one during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear, and a separate incident at his West Palm Beach golf club on Sept. 15 when a suspect fled after the Secret Service opened fire.

Launched 2024 campaign 2 years ago

Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022, at his home in Florida, shortly after Republicans fell short of their expectations of a ""red wave"" in the midterm elections. He built his campaign on retribution, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a continued populist shift in his economic and social policies.

He held his first rally in Waco, Texas, months later, on March 24, 2023 — the 30th anniversary of the standoff there between federal agents and Branch Davidian cult led by David Koresh that led to the death of 82 members. Trump characterized his own race as the ""final battle"" and promised vengeance against perceived political enemies.

""I am your warrior, I am your justice,"" Trump said, flanked by ""witch hunt"" signs surrounding the stage. ""For those who have been wronged and betrayed … I am your retribution.""

United States v. Donald J. Trump

Trump's 2024 campaign was for a few months dominated by the four indictments against him. In March 2023, he was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on fraud charges stemming from his role in hush money payments made to an adult film star before the 2016 election.

In addition to the New York case, Trump was indicted in two separate federal cases filed by special counsel Jack Smith. He faced charges in Florida of mishandling classified documents he tried to keep at his home after his presidency at his home. That case was dismissed by a judge who ruled that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional. Smith is appealing that decision.

In Washington, D.C., he faces charges over his alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election. The judge in this case has yet to set a date for the trial as the parties remain in litigation over what classified material can be included, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that presidents have some immunity from prosecution for official actions taken while in office.

In Georgia, he was indicted with over a dozen others on charges stemming from efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. That case has been on hold by an appeals court since June.

Trump pleaded not guilty in all of the cases against him.

Trump's first indictment and only conviction in the New York hush money trial only bolstered his poll numbers and his fundraising, solidifying his control over the Republican Party in the early stages of the primary campaign. Within 24 hours of his conviction, he raised over $52.8 million.

Republican primaries

Trump faced a number of primary opponents, including two who served in his administration, former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. At the outset, Trump's biggest threat appeared to be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a conservative governor whose state had the strongest showing for Republicans in the midterm elections. But DeSantis failed to gain traction with GOP voters and dropped his bid in January after finishing 30 points behind Trump in the Iowa caucuses.

Haley, Trump's remaining primary opponent, won only two contests — Vermont and Washington, D.C. Trump never participated in a primary debate.

Once Trump clinched the nomination, he installed loyalists inside the Republican National Committee, naming North Carolina GOP chairman Michael Whatley and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the party's co-chairs. The pair focused on ""election integrity"" in battleground states, filing lawsuits over voter rolls and early-voting laws while they worked to convince conservatives that the early voting system Trump disparaged for years was necessary for him to win.

Trump continued to cast doubt on early voting, which he saw as a tool for Democrats to try to steal the 2024 election from him.

A new race — and an assassination attempt

After Trump and Mr. Biden clinched their respective nominations, their debate, hosted by CNN, was scheduled for June 27. It became the most consequential debate in U.S. history when Mr. Biden's performance, marred by gaffes, unfinished sentences and mumbling, caused Democratic leaders and voters to question his ability to serve another term because of his age.

Trump did not campaign for 10 days following the debate, as a growing list of Democrats called on Mr. Biden's cognitive ability to continue his reelection bid.

Mid-July was a turning point in the 2024 race, upending the presidential campaign.

On July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, when his ear was grazed by a bullet after a gunman fired several times at him during a rally just before the Republican convention.

A day and a half later, Trump tapped Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, a first-term senator and bestselling author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" to be his running mate.

Days later he accepted the Republican Party nomination for the third time, making him the first Republican to secure the party nomination three times since Richard Nixon.

A few days later, Mr. Biden exited the race and backed Harris for the Democratic nomination.

Just two months after the attempt on his life in Butler, Trump's life was put in danger again after an attempted gunman, armed with a rifle, was spotted at his golf course in West Palm Beach on Sept. 15. Trump returned to Butler on Oct. 5 for a rally with Elon Musk.

Focus on Harris in final days of campaign

With Mr. Biden out of the race, Trump trained their attention onto Harris, whom he disparaged as ""low IQ"" and ""stupid.""

The Trump campaign labeled Harris ""border czar"" – a reference to her assignment by Mr. Biden to address the root causes of migration into the U.S. from central American countries – and repeatedly attacked her on immigration. He profanely disparaged her, calling Harris a ""sh** vice president"" and claiming she was ""importing illegal alien rapists and murderers.""

Immigration was a constant in all of three of Trump's bids for the White House. He promised mass deportations for migrants and promised to establish the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen.

In the final week before the election, his campaign was embroiled in controversy. His rally at New York's Madison Square Garden was overshadowed by comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage,"" among other racist jokes.

During an interview with Tucker Carlson, he called former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his most vocal critics, a ""war hawk"" and suggested she'd have a different opinion on foreign wars if she had guns pointed at her.

Trump also ramped up his rhetoric against the media, telling supporters two days before the election that he wouldn't mind if someone tried to shoot through the media riser to assassinate him, as he complained about the bulletproof glass positioned around him.

In his closing message on the trail in Georgia, Trump promised greatness if he won.

""After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,"" Trump said. ""You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.""","Donald Trump wins election in historic comeback after 2020 loss, indictments and bruising campaign  CBS News",CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-win-presidency-2024/
"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Experts: What does a Trump presidency mean for climate action? - Carbon Brief,"The Republican candidate Donald Trump has been elected as the 47th US president, beating his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris in a “historic comeback”.

In response, climate scientists, researchers and experts have expressed concern about his election’s impact on efforts to tackle climate change.

During his first term in 2017-2021, Trump – a climate sceptic – rolled back climate regulations and pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, a move he has promised to repeat.

He continued to attack climate action and science throughout his campaign in the run-up to the 5 November election. He lent heavily on his mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, as well as announcing he wanted to “terminate” spending on what he calls the “green new deal” – understood to be a reference to 2023’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump’s election could lead to an additional 4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) of US emissions by 2030, compared to continuing current-president Joe Biden’s plans, Carbon Brief analysis found earlier this year.

Following the election, we gathered a panel of experts to discuss via a webinar what his win could mean for climate action. Moderated by Carbon Brief editor Leo Hickman, Li Shuo from the Asia Society Policy Institute, Mo Adow from Power Shift Africa, Camilla Born MBE and Carbon Brief’s deputy editor and senior policy editor Simon Evans answered a range of questions from the online audience.

These ranged from what Trump’s election could mean for Chinese action on climate and what it will mean for discussions at COP29, to how it will impact the spread of misinformation and expectations of Elon Musk’s involvement in the administration.

A full recording of the webinar can be seen below:

Additionally, Carbon Brief asked a range of scientists, policy experts and campaigners from around the world what they think a Trump presidency could mean for climate action.

These are their responses, first as sample quotes, then, below, in full:

As a lead author for the National Climate Assessment during the previous Trump administration, I’ve personally witnessed how federal decisions can impact climate action.

Some decisions are highly visible, like rolling back legislation, removing environmental protections and pulling out of global treaties. However, quieter and more behind-the-scenes decisions that restrict scientists’ access to data, limit research and funding and discourage public communication of critical findings can be equally chilling.

It’s essential to remember that forward momentum doesn’t rely solely on federal action. While policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act provide critical momentum, progress can and must happen at all levels: cities, states, businesses, organisations and more.

This election, for example, climate- and nature-positive ballot initiatives were passed in more than a dozen states. Groups such as the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and America Is All In represent nearly two-thirds of the US. And organisations like the Nature Conservancy remain dedicated to implementing effective solutions for a safer, healthier and more just future.

Science is clear that “every action matters”. That’s why, despite the coming headwind, it’s more vital than ever to continue striving for a resilient future for people and nature. It’s not about saving the planet: it’s about saving us.

Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs

Domestically, among the most consequential impacts of a second Trump term on climate action will be regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). President Trump has been critical of the IRA, vowing to rescind unspent IRA funds and end EV tax credits. Particularly with the possibility of Republican control of Congress, there may be more legislative ability to roll back parts of the IRA. At the same time, given that we have seen bipartisan support for parts of the IRA in Republican-leaning states because of the investments being generated, I could see a scenario where some of the IRA’s domestic manufacturing provisions remain in place.

Additionally, we could see some expansion of clean-energy generation capacity in the Trump administration, particularly nuclear energy, for which Trump has voiced support. This would come at a time when some of America’s largest tech companies are actively looking to invest in nuclear and other forms of clean, firm power generation to meet the rapidly growing energy needs of artificial intelligence. Given growing tensions between the US and China, Republicans and Democrats should both be able to agree that it is in America’s economic and security interests to maintain our leadership position in AI.

Internationally, Trump quite notably withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement in the first days of his first term in office and has pledged to do so again if re-elected. On top of that, he has also said he plans to withdraw the US from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, a potentially more impactful move that, if successful, would remove the US from participating in COP negotiations and global climate cooperation more broadly.

Irrespective of how one aligns politically, the case for pursuing a thriving low-carbon economy has never been stronger, both scientifically and economically. Scientifically, we understand how the extreme weather we have seen over the past years is of our own making, a result of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.

We also understand that these impacts will become unacceptable and unmanageable with unchecked climate change. Meanwhile, clean renewable energy that generates high-quality jobs has become the economically sane choice in many countries. Political decisions that disregard evidence are putting us on societal dead-end streets that will be harshly course-corrected by the hard physical reality of climate change catching up.

Back to top

Trump’s win is no doubt bad news for US climate action. It will also have a spillover effect for global climate politics, casting a shadow over COP29. Other countries will need to step up to fill the leadership gap. The EU and China will need to be critical partners in this endeavour.

Trump’s win will not change the global green transition. Green energy is becoming cheaper and more competitive. This economic trend, not politics, will lead action from now on.

I expect countries, including China, to reaffirm their commitments to the Paris Agreement at the start of COP29. Their resolve to manage the climate finance debate in Baku will be the earliest test of the resilience of the climate regime. Unlike 2016, the global community is prepared.

I am confident we will weather the immediate impact, but I am worried about the long-term implications of this election.

Back to top

Ultimately, no one can run from the climate crisis, not even Donald Trump. Extreme weather is killing people, economies and livelihoods are being wrecked, the science is clear, and the solutions are known. The rest of the world won’t just stand by and let one man’s ignorance ruin the home we all share.

Climate action is not a wall where if you remove one brick it falls down. It is like a trampoline with many springs. If you take one out, others can bear the load. The impetus for climate action over the next four years will not come from the politics of the White House, it will come from the economics of clean energy, from Europe, emerging markets and sub-national actors in the US and around the world.

For Africa, this is an opportunity to step up and fill the void left by the US presidency. Africa has vast renewable energy potential combined with the moral authority of being victims of climate harm but not perpetrators. With the right investment from other countries, African nations can demonstrate how it’s possible to break the link between development and fossil fuels and raise up a continent of climate champions to showcase the power of clean energy.

While we don’t know exactly what policies President-elect Trump will pursue on the domestic or global stage, both domestic climate policy and multilateral cooperation are facing a time of extreme uncertainty and stress, given his statements on expanding oil and gas production, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and rolling back key climate and clean energy measures.

Any retreat from progress would be a significant mistake. As the mounting impacts of climate-related disasters make abundantly clear, the world needs to accelerate climate action. And such action is advantageous for the US – for our economy, our energy security and for our foreign policy interests.

In a few days, representatives from 197 countries as well as a delegation of US governors, mayors, corporate CEOs and civil society leaders will travel to Baku to advance the crucial work of climate cooperation. COP29 has both the opportunity and obligation to drive forward progress on scaling up climate finance, transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to cleaner, more secure energy sources and building greater resilience to mounting climate impacts.

Back to top

Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and supports fossil fuel expansion. His election as president of the richest and most technologically capable country with the greatest responsibility for cumulative emissions cannot but set back the fight against climate change.

But it is also true that the problem goes deeper than an individual president. For example, because of the divided polity in the US and its political system of multiple “veto points”, the world’s largest historical emitter finds it impossible to appropriate essential public funds for climate finance, under any president. This contributes to simmering feelings of global climate injustice.

Which is why, at climate negotiations, it is critical that the world not bend backwards to try and mould the climate regime around the vagaries of US political currents, nor press pause on building out critical elements of the climate regime.

Meanwhile, our friends in the US will need to take defensive measures at home by, for example, doubling down on action in US states (again!). And by mobilising political support from beneficiary Republican states to maintain clean energy technology subsidies.

Failing this, the US public may well find that a Trump-induced sabbatical from the clean-energy race (which they are by no means winning even now) may cost them dearly in foregone jobs and competitiveness in technologies of the future.

Back to top

In a word, the biggest impact Trump’s election has on climate action is on “confidence”.

We are in a different world than we were the first time around and there are many more equities invested in the transition. People are making money, doing jobs and cutting their bills because of clean energy and technology. And after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there is a growing recognition that fossil fuel dependency is risky and not consistent with security.

But for those on the fence, still making choices, the confidence dent could slow or knock their transition off course. This is potentially particularly true in emerging and developing economies where the transition is less mature.

Having said that, the other major difference this time is that China is so heavily politically and economically invested in the transition and they will want to maintain and grow export markets for their low-carbon tech.

There’s no doubt a strong and climate-positive US voice on the international stage helps immensely, there is now a significant vacuum to fill to inspire confidence, shape markets and maximise the opportunities the transition brings.

Back to top

The climate crisis doesn’t care who is in the White House. If President Trump’s last time in office was anything to go by, there will be chaos and mayhem, but the climate movement will be defiant and continue fighting. The rest of the world will continue working.

Working together to address the climate crisis is in every nation’s self-interest. The impacts of climate know no boundaries and are felt across the world, including in the US. Nearly 200 countries carried on working on climate during the first Trump presidency – collaborating with many US states and cities – and we fully expect that to carry on.

The US is still in the climate battle. The energy transition is inevitable and accelerating in many countries and across the US, regardless of who is in power. If Trump steps out of the global clean energy race, they will be the losers. First-mover countries will be the winners. Trump can withdraw from the Paris Agreement, or the UNFCCC as a whole, at his own peril. The US will lose its ability to influence the decisions that will change the trajectory of the world’s economic development.

While the news that Trump plans to leave the Paris Agreement could cause initial anxiety at COP29, the world’s majority recognises that climate action does not hinge on who is in power in the US, and as we saw before and will see again, other countries will step up if the US reneges on their responsibilities and stands back. But the US will still be held accountable, by their own citizens as well as by governments and people across the world.

The Trump administration also cannot think that it can leave the Paris Agreement, and still come to climate meetings and obstruct progress. We will not allow this obstruction even if the US stays in the Paris Agreement.

"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Donald Trump’s Cabinet of Wonders - The New Yorker,"In the first few days after the reëlection of Donald Trump, one heard across the fruited plains and the canyons of the great cities a noisy welter of accusation, self-laceration, celebration, and rationalization. There were also conspicuous assurances of normalcy that went like this: The sun went down in the evening and came up in the morning. Democracy did not end or even falter; the election was democracy, after all. The once and future President would surely dispense with his frenzied campaign threats and get down to the mundane task of governing. Making America great yet again required sobriety and competence, and Trump and his councillors would undoubtedly recognize that obligation.

For the titans of business, the new Administration promised untold prosperity: regulation would ease, tax rates decline. Elon Musk would make government just as civil, generous, and “efficient” as his social-media platform, X. Jeff Bezos, having ordered the editorial board of his newspaper to spike its endorsement of Kamala Harris, selflessly tweeted “big congratulations” to Trump, on his “extraordinary political comeback.” Wall Street executives and Sand Hill Road philosophers exulted that the “mergers-and-acquisitions climate” would now bring opportunities beyond imagining. (How these opportunities might benefit the working class they presumably would clarify at a later date.)

Meanwhile, the President-elect convened his loyalists at Mar-a-Lago, where they went about putting together a White House staff and a Cabinet. Historically, this is a deliberative process that can, even with the noblest intentions, go horribly wrong. In “The Best and the Brightest,” David Halberstam wrote about an American tradition of mandarins in Washington as

an aristocracy come to power, convinced of its own disinterested quality, believing itself above both petty partisan interest and material greed. The suggestion that this also meant the holding and wielding of power was judged offensive by these same people, who preferred to view their role as service.

Halberstam’s larger subject was the aristocracy of Robert McNamara, Dean Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, and all the other exceptional men of the Ivy League and corporate boardrooms who helped guide the country into the Vietnam War.

At least as a matter of rhetoric, Trump is uninterested in conventional notions of expertise (which smacks of élitism). Nor is he focussed on assembling a council of constructive disagreement, a team of rivals (which smacks of disloyalty). As his personnel choices rolled out in recent days, it became clear that they pointed wholly to his long-held priorities—and they are not the common good. The nominations of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, and Tulsi Gabbard as the director of National Intelligence are the residue of Trump’s resentments and his thirst for retribution.

In Gaetz, who faces allegations (which he denies) of illegal drug use and having sex with an underage girl, Trump sees himself, a man wrongly judged, he insists, as liable for sexual abuse. In Kennedy, an anti-vax conspiracy theorist, he sees a vindication of his own suspicion of science and his wildly erratic handling of the Covid crisis. In Hegseth, who defends war criminals and lambastes “woke” generals, he sees vengeance against the military establishmentarians who called him unfit. In Gabbard, who finds the good in foreign dictators, he sees someone who might shape the work of the intelligence agencies to help justify ending U.S. support for Ukraine. In other words, Trump’s nominations—in their reckless endorsement of the dangerously unqualified—look like the most flagrant act of vindictive trolling since the rise of the Internet. But it is a trolling beyond mischief. All these appointees are meant to bolster Trump’s effort to lay waste to the officials and the institutions that he has come to despise or regard as threats to his power or person. These appointees are not intended to be his advisers. They are his shock troops.

Or could it be that the President-elect is out to reduce the country to the status of a global laughingstock? Until this spate of appointments, observers had long remarked that Trump had no sense of humor. Al Franken, late of the U.S. Senate and “Saturday Night Live,” is among those who have said that they have never heard Trump laugh. Smirk, perhaps, at the misfortune of others, but not laugh in the joyful sense.

Back in the days when Trump swanned about Manhattan as a caricature rich guy and gonif construction magnate, he was part of a metropolitan jokescape, up there in lights with John Gotti and Leona Helmsley. Spy, the satirical magazine of its time, fact-checked his finances (inflated) and his books (preposterous). Trump was not amused. His lawyers sent frequent letters to the editors, threatening litigation. He found himself in a similar mood, many years later, when Barack Obama, who had suffered Trump’s constant insinuations about his place of birth, took the occasion of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner to rib the political aspirations of the host of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Trump left the ballroom in a funk, nurturing, perhaps, an ominous resolve.

Trump has always been obsessed with dramas of dominance and submission, strength and weakness, who is laughing at whom. This is his lens for human relations generally, and particularly when it comes to politics, foreign and domestic. As long ago as January, 2016, Niraj Chokshi, then an enterprising reporter for the Washington Post, calculated the many times that Trump had pointed out that someone—Russia, China, OPEC, “the Persians,” “the mullahs”—was “laughing at us.” More recently, in this, his third Presidential campaign, Trump told a crowd at Mar-a-Lago, “November 5th is going to go down as the single most important day in the history of our country.” He added, “Right now, we’re not respected. Right now, our country is known as a joke. It’s a joke.”

Now Trump’s critics and an increasing number of his supporters are taking stock of his most disgraceful appointments—these men and women of perfect jawlines, dubious reputations, and rotten ideas. They wonder if this is not the ultimate joke, with national endangerment as its punch line. Dean Acheson, who helped Harry Truman design NATO and rebuild Europe under the Marshall Plan, titled his memoir “Present at the Creation.” Which of Donald Trump’s new advisers will line up to write the sequel? ♦",Donald Trump’s Cabinet of Wonders  The New Yorker,The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/11/25/donald-trumps-cabinet-of-wonders

How Trump, 78, won re-election will be the stuff of history books, and already America’s choice can be traced to some key decisions. To Trump’s top aides, the thesis of the campaign could be summed up in a simple slogan: “Max out the men and hold the women.” That meant emphasizing the economy and immigration, which Trump did relentlessly. It meant diverting attention away from the chaos of his first term, the abortion bans he ushered in, and his assault on American democracy four years ago. It meant a campaign that rode the resentment of disenchanted voters and capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited.

Most of all, the outcome can be credited to a singular figure whose return to the White House traced a political arc unlike any in 250 years of American history. Trump left office in 2021 a pariah after inciting a mob of supporters to ransack the U.S. Capitol at the end of an attempt to overturn his electoral defeat. Three years later, he engineered an unprecedented political comeback. Trump effortlessly dispatched his GOP rivals, forced President Joe Biden out of the race, and vanquished Vice President Kamala Harris in a dominant victory that exceeded virtually everyone’s expectations. Along the way, Trump shrugged off a 34-count felony conviction and an array of other criminal indictments.

The scale of his success was stunning. Trump carried North Carolina, flipped Georgia back to his column, and smashed through the Blue Wall. His campaign outperformed its goal of turning out men and holding women. Exit polls showed Trump winning large numbers of Latino men in key battleground states, improving his numbers with that group in Pennsylvania from 27% to 42%. Nationally, Trump's support among Latino men leaped from 36% to 54%. Trump also increased his share of voters without a college degree, gained ground with Black voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and held steady nationally with white women, shocking Democrats who had expected a post-Dobbs uprising. Among first-time voters, Trump boosted his support from 32% four years ago to a 54% majority.

He got his share of big breaks. When Trump launched this campaign on the heels of a third straight rebuke in national elections, Republican leaders tried to ignore him. His primary opponents were too timid to take him on. A combination of friendly judges and legal postponements pushed his most damning criminal trials to after the election. Until July, Trump’s general-election opponent was an unpopular incumbent viewed by many as too old to continue in the job. Biden only confirmed those suspicions when he bumbled through their first, and only, debate. The Democrats’ hasty replacement of the first-term president with Harris deprived them of a better-tested candidate who could potentially have rallied broader support. Voters took Trump’s own advanced age and increasingly incoherent trail rhetoric in stride. Much of the country read Trump’s legal woes as part of a larger corrupt conspiracy to deny him, and them, power. And he benefited from a global restiveness in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that has ousted incumbent leaders around the world.

The consequences may be historic. Trump has dominated American politics for nine years now, and after four years of his tumultuous presidency punctuated by an insurrection, the country chose to reinstall him. Trump campaigned on an authoritarian agenda that would upend America’s democratic norms, and he is already preparing to deliver on it: mass detention and deportations of migrants; revenge against political enemies via the justice system; deploying the military against his own civilians. How far he chooses to go with the power the public has handed him is a question that will shape the fate of the country.

To the MAGA faithful, Trump’s victory is a thrilling vision coming into view. For the less fervent supporters who helped put him over the top, his rhetoric is largely bluster in service of reforming a government out of touch with America’s economic and social needs. To the rest of the country and much of the world, a second Trump term looks like a blow to democracy in the U.S. and beyond. That split screen will animate American discourse for the next four years. The nation is more polarized than at any point since the Civil War. But soon, there will be at least one thing that binds us all together: Come Jan. 20, we will all be living in Trump’s America. This account of how Trump did it, based on more than 20 interviews over the last eight months, offers a glimpse of what that may look like.

As always, the strategy started with Trump’s instinct. In April 2023, he was huddled with advisers at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, days after he had made history as the first former President charged with a crime. The subject of the conversation: How could he control the political narrative? Trump had just gotten off the phone with his friend Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. There was a fight that Saturday in Miami. “I think those guys would love me,” Trump said.

When Trump entered the arena on April 10, he was met with thunderous applause. While there, he ran into the Nelk Boys, a group of influencers who host a right-wing podcast. Trump had gone on their show a year earlier, but it was removed by YouTube for spreading election lies. The chance meeting led to a second appearance. His closest confidantes didn’t realize it at the time, but interviews on male-focused podcasts would become a throughline of his extraordinary political resurrection.

It’s easy to forget how shaky Trump’s prospects seemed at the outset of his campaign. He announced his third bid for the White House in Nov. 2022, days after Republicans took a beating in the midterms—the third straight national election in which the former President was seen as a drag on his party. Trump’s hand-picked candidates embraced his lie that the 2020 election was stolen and lost critical races across the country. Elected Republicans took it as a sign that America was done with Trump and nearly all shunned his grievance-riddled kickoff speech at Mar-a-Lago. They just hoped he would fade away.

But the early campaign launch turned out to be a savvy move, positioning Trump to cast his looming criminal prosecutions as politically motivated. With each indictment, he gained ground with the GOP base and raked in millions in cash. His primary challengers spent more time trying to beat up on each other than take out the man who stood in their way. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, arguably Trump’s most formidable opponent, dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. By March, Trump had secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Republican nominee. It was the fastest contested presidential primary in modern American history.

Trump’s landslide in the primary was the product of a strategy honed by Trump’s two campaign managers: Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. Wiles, a veteran Florida-based strategist, had worked for DeSantis’s 2018 run for governor, but they had a falling out after he was sworn in. Following the 2020 presidential election, Wiles took charge of Trump’s primary PAC, Save America. In exile but already plotting his path back to Washington, Trump suspected his toughest obstacle in the 2024 primary would likely be DeSantis, sources close to him say. Who better to help him than Wiles?

Wiles recruited LaCivita, a hard-nosed Republican operative. Together, they drafted the campaign’s strategy. The MAGA base was strong enough to assure Trump’s victory in the GOP primaries, they concluded, giving them time to test-run a plan to defeat Biden in November. Trump’s team focused on building an operation that could identify and turn out Trump supporters who were not reliable voters.

Wiles and LaCivita, political director James Blair, and Trump’s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizo, believed that gender would be key. In 2020, Biden won by holding the same 13-point lead among women that Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016, while narrowing the gap among men by five points. “Men cost us the last election,” a top Trump campaign source says. “Our objective became not to let that happen again.”

Surveys found that men, particularly young men, were turning away from Biden the most, especially over the economy. In a head-to-head matchup, Trump’s lead was the most dominant among unreliable male voters younger than 40. Advisers concentrated on activating this cohort, which, by and large, saw Biden as an elderly man who shouldn’t be President. These young men didn’t get their news from mainstream media and were less concerned with reproductive rights or democratic backsliding. When they did interact with politics, it was mostly through edgy bro podcasts and social media. They appreciated Trump’s brashness and habit of smashing norms. It was a risk to focus significant energy on turning out voters who don’t care much about politics. But LaCivita would often repeat a Winston Churchill line that became a campaign mantra: “To try to be safe everywhere is to be strong nowhere.”

As Trump pursued the male vote, he also had to avoid losing women by larger margins than in 2016 and 2020—no easy feat after his Supreme Court appointments helped overturn Roe v. Wade and pave the way for abortion bans across the country. Whenever abortion came up, Trump insisted the issue was now up to the states, and pivoted as much as possible to the economy, immigration, and crime—issues the campaign believed triggered anxiety with well-to-do suburban women who were open to backing him.

When Trump spoke with TIME in April 2024, Biden’s poll numbers were tanking and Trump’s camp believed they were well on their way to a decisive victory. In two interviews, Trump laid out a second-term agenda that would reshape America and its role in the world. All the while, a constellation of Trump-allied groups, such as the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and the Center for Renewing America, were laying the groundwork to implement Trump’s strongman vision. Many of their ideas—from imposing harsh abortion restrictions to gutting environmental protections and placing the entire federal bureaucracy under presidential control—were broadly unpopular with wide swaths of the electorate. But Trump seemed to think a victory in the fall was preordained.

The campaign’s confidence only grew over an intense three weeks that began with Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate performance. On July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt in Butler, Pa., with the shooter’s bullet piercing his ear and Trump rising to his feet and pumping his fist as blood streaked down his face, a spectacle of defiance that thrilled his supporters. Trump’s announcement of 39-year-old Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate at the Republican convention days later seemed like a statement of confidence that the MAGA movement would endure long after its leader exited the scene.

The high didn’t last for long. Three days after the GOP convention concluded, Biden announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris. In a matter of days, the Vice President consolidated Democratic support. Soon she was outraising Trump by hundreds of millions of dollars, and hosting rallies that attracted the kind of attendance and enthusiasm her party hadn’t seen since the Obama era. Trump’s victory no longer seemed like a foregone conclusion.

In a series of meetings in Palm Beach and at Trump’s New Jersey golf club, Wiles, LaCivita and their staff held bull sessions to address the threats posed by their new opponent. A younger candidate made it harder for them to attract voters disillusioned with Biden. Holding down losses with women while running against one would be even tougher. Democratic efforts to tie Trump to extreme agendas like that of Project 2025 were starting to bear fruit. Early internal polling indicated the challenge, according to Trump sources. Fabrizio had surveys showing that there was a broad appetite for change, and the biggest risk they had was letting Harris become the change-agent candidate.

The Trump team began running ads, and having their surrogates go on cable television, blaming Harris for Biden’s presidency, surmising that she would inherit many of the same vulnerabilities of her boss. They focused on her role working on immigration for the Administration, in which she was assigned to address the root causes of migration from Central America, to blame her for a surge in border crossings. At the same time, Trump set out to distance himself from Project 2025, while working to paint Harris as further to the left than she really is.

Privately, the campaign estimated that Trump’s message on abortion—to leave it to the states—was insufficient. Surveys showed that abortion rights were the third or fourth most important issue to voters. After months of Trump dancing around the issue of federal restrictions, Trump's top lieutenants told him it was time to address it head on. On Oct. 1, Trump posted on Truth Social that he wouldn’t support a national ban.

There were internal challenges as well. Trump was becoming increasingly restless and agitated. He brought in allies from his previous campaigns, including Corey Lewandowski, one of his 2016 campaign managers. One of the most consistent proponents of “let Trump be Trump,” Lewandowski believed Wiles and LaCivita were blowing it, according to multiple campaign officials. In August, Lewandowski held a meeting with Trump in which he advised the Republican nominee to fire his entire campaign leadership, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Trump made no commitments but nodded and heard him out. Wiles and LaCivita soon held a meeting with Trump to say that Lewandowski was creating a distraction, throwing the campaign off course. What they have been doing has worked, Wiles told him, and it was not the time to deviate. Trump agreed. On his next plane ride, he held a meeting with all of them, including Lewandowski, who over the final weeks of the race was sidelined as an adviser, largely relegated to appearances on cable news.

Harris’ momentum seemed to continue through September. She won the lone debate between the two candidates, baiting Trump into mistakes. “There was a lot of internal worry that she was a stronger opponent than we realized and that the ground has shifted,” says a top Trump official. But the campaign was relieved a week later, when polling showed that the debate hardly changed the race and that the candidates were tied. Trump returned to his mantra: accelerate the push to win over young, male voters. In late July, Wiles tasked Alex Bruesewitz, a 27-year-old GOP consultant, with presenting Trump with a list of online podcast personalities for interviews, several people familiar with the matter tell TIME. Bruesewitz and Danielle Alvarez, another Trump senior adviser, reached Trump on the golf course the next morning.

""I have a list of podcasts I wanted to pitch you on,"" Bruesewitz said. Trump stopped him there. ""Have you talked this over with Barron?"" he asked, referring to his 18-year-old son.

""No, sir,"" Bruesewitz said.

""Call Barron and see what he thinks and let me know,"" Trump said, and abruptly hung up. Bruesewitz reached Barron later that day and learned that he was particularly fond of Adin Ross, a provocateur mostly known for collaborating with celebrities on live-streams of video games, such as NBA2K and Grand Theft Auto. They agreed that’s where Trump should start. The podcast strategy was in motion.

In August, Trump appeared on Ross’ podcast, which went viral, racking up millions of views on the livestream. The ensuing weeks were marked by a succession of fawning interviews with laddish podcast hosts: Logan Paul, Theo Von, Joe Rogan. The campaign made a deliberate decision to avoid most traditional media interviews.

Trump took an unorthodox approach to outsiders. He neutralized a potential third-party threat by offering Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. control over health care policy in exchange for dropping out and endorsing him, Kennedy claimed. The campaign outsourced its most labor-intensive field operations in critical swing states to groups like Turning Point USA and America First Works. In the final weeks of the race, billionaire Elon Musk poured more than $100 million into his own political action committee to help Trump in swing states. Promised the leadership of a new “government efficiency commission” that would oversee the myriad federal agencies that regulate his companies, Musk hired staffers and incentivized them with payouts to reach voters. He personally camped out in Pennsylvania, seen by both sides as the pivotal battleground state, and handed out $1 million checks in sweepstakes for registered voters who signed a petition. Musk also turned X, his social media platform, into a cauldron of conspiracy theories and characterized the stakes of the race to his more than 200 million followers as existential. In the election’s final weeks, he promulgated the far-right conspiracy theory that Democrats were “importing” undocumented immigrants to swing states to irrevocably tilt the electoral map in their favor. “If Trump doesn’t win,” Musk said, “this is the last election.”

As always, Trump’s self-destructive impulses posed a challenge. With a little more than a week before Election Day, he fulfilled a lifelong dream by holding a rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden. The event was marked by hateful, xenophobic and racist rhetoric by Trump’s warm-up speakers. The Trump campaign brought in an array of profane pugilists, including the insult comic Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The campaign did not vet his remarks or upload them into the teleprompter ahead of his routine, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly had recently gone on record saying that Trump praised Hitler’s generals. Trump’s former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Ret. Gen. Mark Milley, called him “fascist to the core.” Internal polling from the Harris campaign indicated that the odiousness of the rally was tipping late-deciding voters in her favor. It seemed like Trump might be imploding at the 11th hour.

Shortly after 9 p.m. on Election Night, Trump entered a ballroom in his Mar-a-Lago club to a raucous ovation and a crowd full of his well-heeled benefactors. Behind him were his family members, including his son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara, and his youngest son Barron. For the next three and a half hours, he watched with glee alongside Musk and White as the returns rolled in even more favorably than his most bullish champions predicted.

Trump’s transition team is stacked with loyalists like former Cabinet secretary Linda McMahon and businessman Howard Lutnick; his sons Don. Jr. and Eric; and his running mate Vance. All of them were tasked with making sure only true believers join his Administration-in-waiting. He’s expected to tap into the network of organizations that have been preparing to implement his ideas. That includes Russ Vought, his former director of the Office of Management and Budget who runs the Center for Renewing America, who has been crafting draft executive orders Trump can sign within his first hours as President.

The first, and most aggressive, agenda item is expected to be immigration and the border. In his interview with TIME, Trump said he plans to use executive power to begin mass deportations of undocumented migrants, ordering the National Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and federal law enforcement to conduct raids. Tom Homan, a former Trump official now affiliated with Project 2025, is expected to lead the effort, according to campaign sources.

At the same time, top Trump advisers tell TIME, there will be a massive purge of the federal bureaucracy. The most satisfying part of that to Trump, they say, will be firing Jack Smith, the Special Counsel prosecuting him on charges of willfully mishandling classified information and conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election.

Trump’s most controversial moves are all but certain to face significant legal and political fights. He has vowed on the campaign trail to pick an attorney general who will investigate and prosecute his political rivals and critics. Trump will be emboldened by a Supreme Court ruling last summer that granted U.S. presidents potential immunity from some criminal prosecution for official acts. Between Trump’s psychological disposition, his vows to seek revenge on his adversaries, and the removal of many of the guardrails that hindered him in a first term, scholars of authoritarianism see a nation on the brink of crisis.

Ultimately the election is as much a judgment on the American people as it is on the man they have returned to office. Trump’s comeback didn’t happen at random. By building a social and political movement that gave him coercive power over the Republican Party, Trump systematically demolished many of the nation’s long-standing norms, ushering in a cohort of lackeys who will enable his most autocratic impulses. He will enter his second term committed to creating a governing environment with few restraints on his power. He did not hide any of this. It was what the American people decided they wanted.

With reporting by Philip Elliott/Washington",How Donald Trump Won the 2024 Election  TIME,TIME,https://time.com/7172052/how-donald-trump-won-2024/
"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:47:49 GMT",Donald Trump,Transition 2025: Did Trump Win an “Unprecedented and Powerful Mandate”? - Council on Foreign Relations,"Donald Trump declared on Election Night, as votes were still being counted, that “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.” Many media outlet echoed his claim by describing his victory as a “landslide,” “resounding,” and “sweeping.” But was it?

To answer that question, consider how the winning candidate performed in three recent presidential elections. Candidate A won 52.9 percent of the popular vote, notched 365 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up eight Senate seats and twenty-one House seats. Candidate B won 51.3 percent of the popular vote, notched 306 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up three Senate seats while losing thirteen House seats. Candidate C won 49.8 percent of the popular vote, notched 312 electoral votes, and saw his party take control of Congress by picking up four Senate seats while losing one House seat.

Those numbers suggest two possible conclusions. One is that Candidate A had the most impressive victory. The other is that none of the three candidates received a decisive mandate from the voters.

Candidate A is Barack Obama in 2008. Candidate B is Joe Biden in 2020. Candidate C is Trump in 2024.

Trump’s victory certainly pales in comparison to the landslide presidential victories of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 (60.8 percent of the popular vote and 523 electoral votes), Lyndon Johnson in 1964 (61.1 percent and 486), Richard Nixon in 1972 (60.7 percent and 520), or Ronald Reagan in 1984 (58.8 percent and 525).

Indeed, by historical standards Trump’s victory is unimpressive. Consider the following: His margin of victory in the popular vote—which will be at most 1.6 percentage points when all the votes are counted—is the fifth smallest of the thirty-two presidential races held since 1900. More people in 2024 voted for a candidate not named Trump than did. A shift of roughly 235,000 votes in the right combination in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would have elected Harris. And while Trump increased his vote total by 2.7 million in 2024 compared to 2020, he still fell more than four million short of the number that Biden won four years ago.

That Trump exaggerated his victory is no sin. All winning candidates—not just those who habitually oversell their achievements—tout their triumphs. After all, election mandates are what you make of them.

Trump’s cabinet picks suggest that he will govern as if his performance matched those of FDR, LBJ, Nixon, and Reagan. Perhaps he will succeed in solving America’s problems as he has vowed, thereby earning more freedom to enact his ambitious agenda.

The Obama and Biden presidencies, however, suggest that Trump’s mandate is not as powerful as he thinks. Both Democrats began their presidencies with the political winds at their back. Yet, their decisions in office met opposition and their popularity steadily fell. Both then saw their party lose control of the House for the second half of their term, derailing their policy agendas.

Much the same could happen to Trump, perhaps even more quickly. He seems intent on changing almost everything about the U.S. government. But disruptions exact a political price that fellow Republicans may not be willing to pay. Matt Gaetz’s withdrawal from consideration to be attorney general in the face of likely Senate opposition offers an early case in point.

Beyond that, Trump won primarily because the election was a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration—a framing that the Trump campaign team worked hard to establish. Voters did not necessarily embrace Trump or his policy agenda, which left most details to the imagination. Election exit polls found that he had a favorability rating of just 48 percent. Forty-four percent of voters had a very unfavorable view, suggesting that he has a limited political upside.

Trump is also inheriting a robust economy, even if many voters think otherwise. That economic success is easier to derail than it is to sustain. Trump’s plans for mass deportations, tariffs, and massive deficit spending could send the economy into reverse. Election 2024 showed that American politics has at least one iron law: Voters punish the governing party when they believe the economy is faltering.

Finally, Trump faces one other looming liability: He is a lame duck. While he towers over American politics for now, Election 2028 will eventually exert its gravitational pull. Trump cannot run for a third term. (And no, the Twenty-Second Amendment will not be repealed.) Leading Republicans at some point will worry less about how to please Trump and more about how to advance their own presidential ambitions.

None of this is to say that Trump’s second term will be inconsequential. Far from it. He can and likely will change U.S. policy in profound and perhaps irreversible ways. But the real lesson of Election 2024 is that America remains deeply divided politically even as it produced a clear winner. So rather than ushering in a new era in American politics, the political winds that now favor Trump could easily turn against him.

The Vote

Seventeen days after Election Day, votes continue to be counted in some races—and in a few cases, recounted. As of this morning, three House races have yet to be called. Two of those races are in California, the other is in Iowa. The margins in all three races are less than a thousand votes. If the candidates currently leading each race win, Republicans will have 221 seats in the new House and Democrats 214.

All the Senate races have now been settled. Last night, Pennsylvania’s incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey conceded his race to Republican challenger Dave McCormick. The race had been called for McCormick two weeks ago with thousands of votes still to be counted. Casey hoped, however, that in a race in which he trailed by less than 17,000 votes out of the nearly 6.8 million cast, that he might pull out a miraculous, come-from-behind victory. Pennsylvania began an automatic vote recount earlier this week, but Casey ultimately acknowledged that the recount would likely change only a few hundred votes.

What Trump Is Saying

Trump said little in public this week about foreign policy. He did use a Truth Social post to confirm that he plans to declare a national emergency over illegal immigration and use the U.S. military to implement his plans for mass deportations.

Trump also used his announcement of Chris Wright to be secretary of energy to declare that he plans to “drive U.S. Energy Dominance, which will drive down inflation, win the A.I. arms race with China (and others), and expand American Diplomatic Power to end Wars all across the World.” The last few words hardly sound like isolationism.

What the Biden Administration Is Doing

Biden has reversed course in recent weeks on several long-standing aspects of his policy toward Ukraine. Two weeks ago, he agreed to allow U.S. military contractors to operate in Ukraine. This week he agreed to send anti-personnel mines to the country, and perhaps more importantly, authorized Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles against targets in Russia. The Biden administration argued that the changing military situation on the ground necessitated the changes in what had been longstanding policy. Trump so far has said nothing about these moves. However, several of his allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., accused Biden of trying to box in his successor at the risk of starting “World War III.”

Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Lima, Peru, on the margins of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The two leaders called for cooperation on critical issues like artificial intelligence and nuclear weapons. They did not, however, strike any significant agreements. Xi did say that he is “ready to work with the next U.S. administration” and urged the United States to make a “wise choice and keep relations stable.”

The Biden administration vetoed a UN Security Council resolution this week calling for a ceasefire in Gaza because the resolution failed to link the ceasefire to the release of hostages that Hamas holds. The administration also sent a special envoy to Beirut to try to negotiate a ceasefire in southern Lebanon and sanctioned an Israeli company that the State Department called “the largest organization involved in settlement and illegal outpost development in the West Bank.”

Trump’s Appointments

Trump named Matthew Whitaker to be the U.S. ambassador to NATO. He served as acting attorney general in the first Trump administration and was rumored to be a candidate for that position in the second Trump administration. Like many of the people Trump has named to his national security team, Whitaker brings no significant foreign-policy experience to the job. A lawyer by trade, he has worked primarily on domestic law enforcement matters.

Trump named former Republican Representative Pete Hoekstra of Michigan to be ambassador to Canada. Hoekstra does have significant foreign-policy experience. Besides serving in the U.S. House for eighteen years, including three years as chair the House Intelligence Committee, he was U.S. ambassador to The Netherlands, his native country, during the first Trump administration.

What the Pundits Are Writing

The Washington Post reported that Trump continues to ignore the traditional transition process. Among other things, “Trump has yet to collaborate with the General Services Administration, which is tasked with the complex work of handing over control of hundreds of agencies, because he has not turned in required pledges to follow ethics rules. His transition teams have yet to set foot inside a single federal office.”

Derek Grossman argued in Foreign Policy that Trump might give China a run for its money in southeast Asia. In Grossman’s view, the region will applaud “Trump’s likely deprioritizing of promoting values—such as democracy and human rights—abroad in favor of a more transactional approach that strictly aims at achieving U.S. national interests, especially among authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes that comprise most Southeast Asian states. Overall, Trump’s likely policies could put the United States in a better position to compete long-term against China in the region.”

Ana Swanson and Edward Wong asked in the New York Times whether Trump shares the hawkish assessment that his foreign-policy team has of China. They suggest perhaps not: “When it comes to China, Mr. Trump is more transactional than ideological, willing to threaten or impose punishing tariffs to try to land deals that he says will benefit the United States. He has rarely expressed support for human rights and talks of autocrats, including Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in glowing terms. And current close advisers of his, notably Elon Musk, the tycoon who owns Tesla, have important business interests in China.”

Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, argued in Time Magazine that Trump will shake up the world order. In Dalio’s view, Trump will bring about “the end of an era led by the United States, in which countries tried to work out together how to be with each other through multinational organizations with guiding principles and rules, and into a more self-interested, law-of-the-jungle-type order with the United States being one of the two biggest players and China the other— and the fight being largely the classic one of capitalism versus communism (in their contemporary versions).”

The AP’s Joshua Goodman wrote that Marco Rubio will likely reshape U.S. policy toward Latin America should the Senate confirm him as secretary of state. In Goodman’s view, Rubio “is likely to end the neglect” of the region. “But Rubio’s reputation as a national security hawk, embrace of Trump’s plan for mass deportation of migrants and knack for polarizing rhetoric is likely to alienate even some U.S. allies in the region unwilling to fall in line with the incoming president’s America First foreign policy.” Readers with long memories might recall that several recent U.S. administrations, including the Biden administration, came to office pledging to make Latin American a priority and then failed to do so.

Politico’s Adam Cancyrn assessed the Biden administration’s efforts to institutionalize its foreign policy accomplishments. Cancyrn summarized the questionable effectiveness of that strategy with a quote from Ivo Daalder, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO: “There just isn’t anything Biden can do today that isn’t reversible in ten weeks.”

My colleague Edward Alden reviewed Trump’s plans to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. Ted notes that Trump did not match his harsh words on migration during his first term with equivalent actions; he actually ordered fewer deportations than Obama did during his first term. But if Trump does make good on his current promises, Ted argues that “it will reshape migration for a generation or longer—not just in the United States but in much of the world.”

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,World reactions as Donald Trump wins US presidential election - Al Jazeera English,"After a turbulent and defiant campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump will become the country’s 47th president.

Republican Donald Trump has won the US presidential election in a stunning comeback, with projections showing him comfortably clearing the 270 electoral vote threshold required to win the White House.

Speaking in West Palm Beach, Florida, before the latest results came in, Trump pledged to bring a “golden age” to the United States, praising what he called “the greatest political movement of all time”.

His Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, called him to concede defeat on Wednesday before delivering remarks at Howard University in Washington, DC.

World leaders rushed to congratulate Trump as votes were still being counted after early projected wins in key battleground states. Here are some reactions:

Israel

“Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory! In true friendship,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on social media platform X.

Israel Katz, who was named defence minister on Tuesday after Netanyahu fired Yoav Gallant, said, “Together, we’ll strengthen the US-Israel alliance, bring back the hostages, and stand firm to defeat the axis of evil led by Iran”.

Far-right ministers in Netanyahu’s government also celebrated. “Yesssss, God bless Trump,” said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, while Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, “God bless Israel, God bless America.”

Qatar

Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said he looked forward to working with Trump again “in promoting security and stability both in the region and globally”.

Egypt

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said he hoped Trump’s return to the White House could help bring peace to the Middle East.

“I wish him all the success … and I look forward to reaching peace together, upholding regional stability and strengthening the strategic partnership between Egypt and the United States and their friendly peoples,” el-Sisi said on X.

Iran

The livelihoods of Iranians will not be affected by the US election, government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told reporters after a cabinet meeting in the capital, Tehran.

“The US elections are not really our business. Our policies are steady and don’t change based on individuals. We made the necessary predictions before, and there will not be change in people’s livelihoods,” she said.

Hamas

“Our position on the new US administration depends on its positions and practical behaviour towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause,” the Palestinian group said in a statement.

The new president must “listen to the voices of the American community itself rejecting the aggression on Gaza”, it said in a statement, adding that the new US administration “must realise that our people are continuing to confront the occupation and will not accept a path that diminishes their rights”.

Palestinian Authority

“We are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement, reaffirming the Palestinian commitment to “the pursuit of freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.”

Afghanistan

The Taliban government said it hopes for a “new chapter” in relations with the US following Trump’s victory.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on X that they hope the Trump administration “will take realistic steps toward concrete progress in relations between the two countries, and both nations will be able to open a new chapter of relations.”

China

“Our policy towards the US is consistent,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a news briefing.

“We will continue to view and handle China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation,” she added.

Taiwan

President Lai Ching-te expressed confidence that US-Taiwan relations would continue to “serve as a cornerstone for regional stability” as she congratulated Trump on social media.

Ukraine

“I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.”

Russia

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists he was unaware of any plans by President Vladimir Putin to congratulate Trump since the US is an “unfriendly country”.

“We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,” Peskov said.

“Trump has one useful quality for us: as a businessman to the core, he mortally dislikes spending money on various hangers-on and stupid hanger-on allies, on bad charity projects and on voracious international organisations,” former President Dmitry Medvedev posted on the Telegram messaging app.

“We are under no illusions about the American president-elect,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, adding that it will “work with” a new US administration and prioritise achieving its “set goals” in Ukraine.

It said its “conditions” for ending the conflict “are unchanged and are well known in Washington”.

United Kingdom

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Congratulations, President-elect Trump, on your historic election victory. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.”

NATO

Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Trump’s “leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO”.

European Union

“The EU and the US are more than just allies. We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “So let’s work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.”

European Council President Charles Michel said the 27-nation bloc and the US “have an enduring alliance and a historic bond. As allies and friends, the EU looks forward to continuing our constructive cooperation”.

United Nations

“I congratulate President-elect Donald J. Trump, and I reaffirm my belief that the cooperation between the United States and the United Nations is an essential pillar of international relations,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.

“The United Nations stands ready to work constructively with the incoming administration to address the dramatic challenges our world is facing,” he added.

Canada

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the friendship between Canada and the US as “the envy of the world”.

“I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations,” he posted on X.

Mexico

President Claudia Sheinbaum said Trump’s election victory was “no cause for concern” for Mexico but that she would await the official results before congratulating her.

“We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States. I am convinced of this,” she told a news conference. “For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the US], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen – there is no cause for concern.”

Argentina

“Congratulations on your formidable electoral victory,” President Javier Milei said on X. “Now, Make America Great Again. You know that You can count on Argentina to carry out your task.”

Venezuela

Venezuela is ready to establish “good relations” with Washington upon Trump’s return to the White House, according to a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil.

Caracas broke off diplomatic relations with the US during Trump’s first term.

Gil congratulated Trump and called for the US and Venezuela to recognise each country’s “sovereignty and self-determination”. Venezuelans “aspire to follow a path of peace and social justice, where there is no room for war, exclusion, or discrimination, and where cooperation and mutual respect between nations are the standard of international relations,” he added.

Australia

“The election of the President of the United States is always an important moment for the world, for our region and for Australia,” said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “The United States has long played a leadership role in the stability and security of the Indo-Pacific. Australia will strive to strengthen the cooperation between our two nations in the region.”

South Korea

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Inside the Worst Three Weeks of Donald Trump’s 2024 Campaign - The New York Times,"The Aug. 2 dinner at the Bridgehampton, N.Y., home of Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive, was a high-powered affair. Among the roughly 130 people who dined under an air-conditioned tent were some of Donald Trump’s wealthiest supporters, including the billionaire hedge-fund financier Bill Ackman, who sat next to the former president, and Omeed Malik, the president of another fund, 1789 Capital.

Some guests hoped Mr. Trump would signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes. He did not.

Before the dinner, answering a question that voiced concerns about the upcoming election during a small round-table discussion inside Mr. Lutnick’s house, Mr. Trump said, “We’ve got to stop the steal,” reviving yet again his false claims about the 2020 election — claims that his advisers have urged him to drop because they don’t help him with swing voters.

The president-elect campaigned on promises to shake up public health institutions, reshape federal health programs, and slash high costs across the system. Trump has said he’s ready for campaign lieutenants like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “go wild” on health, medicine, and food policy.

Trump repeated that promise in his victory speech. “We can add a few names like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,” Trump told his supporters. “And he’s going to help make America healthy again… He’s a great guy and he really means that he wants to do some things, and we’re going to let him go to it.”",Donald Trump returns to the presidency with big ambitions to shake up health care  STAT,STAT,https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/presidential-election-trump-health-care-abortion-medicare-rfk/
"Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Trump says he ‘shouldn’t have left’ the White House as he closes campaign with increasingly dark message - CNN,"CNN —

Donald Trump, who said in Pennsylvania on Sunday that he regrets leaving the White House in 2021, is ending the 2024 campaign the way he began it — dishing out a stew of violent, disparaging rhetoric and repeated warnings that he will not accept defeat if it comes.

At a rally in the must-win battleground state, the former president told supporters that he “shouldn’t have left” office after losing the 2020 election; described Democrats as “demonic”; complained about a new poll that shows him no longer leading in Iowa, a state he twice carried; and said he wouldn’t mind if a gunman aiming at him also shot through “the fake news.”

Trump spent much of his speech pushing unfounded claims of cheating by Democrats in the 2024 election and sowing doubts about its integrity as polls show him and Vice President Kamala Harris deadlocked nationally. He ranted about alleged election interference this year and lamented his departure from office after losing to Joe Biden four years ago.

“I shouldn’t have left. I mean, honestly, because we did so, we did so well,” Trump said during his rally in Lititz as he claimed the US-Mexico border was more secure under his administration.

It was a rare public admission of regret over participating in the peaceful transfer of power after he incited his supporters to violently storm the US Capitol as he tried to subvert the results of the 2020 election that he lost but refused to concede — something Trump is currently facing federal charges over.

Trump, whose voice sounded hoarse throughout his speech, repeatedly railed against the new Iowa survey released Saturday night, which showed no clear leader between him and Harris in the state.

“We got all this crap going on with the press and with fake stuff and fake polls,” Trump said, claiming the poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom was put out by “one of my enemies.”

The poll delivered a gut punch to those inside Trump’s orbit Saturday night, several people familiar with the reaction told CNN. The former president has been fuming privately over the numbers, arguing the highly anticipated poll should never have been released.

Trump’s advisers have sought to assure him the survey is not accurate, blasting it as way off and telling him there’s always one poll that stands out. His long-standing pollster issued a memo Saturday night arguing it was a “clear outlier.” But the gender breakdown showing that women are driving a shift toward Harris has privately concerned Trump’s allies, with a focus on the poll’s finding that women in Iowa favor Harris over him, 56% to 36%.

At another point during his Lititz rally, the former president, who has been the target of two assassination attempts, suggested he’d be OK with a gunman aiming at him also shooting through the “the fake news.”

“I have this piece of glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news, right? And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind.”

A Trump campaign spokesman said after the rally that the former president was actually musing about how the press was protecting him.

“President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!” Steven Cheung said in a statement.

Responding to Trump’s comments Sunday, a senior Harris campaign official said in a call with reporters that “for Trump, this election really is all about his own grievances and he’s not focused on the American people.”

In his speech, Trump baselessly claimed Democrats are “fighting so hard to steal this damn thing,” and that voting machines would be tampered with.

“They spend all this money, all this money on machines, and they’re going to say, we may take an extra 12 days to determine. And what do you think happens during that 12 days? What do you think happens?” Trump said.

The crowd yelled back: “Cheating!”

“These elections have to be, they have to be decided by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night. Bunch of crooked people, these are crooked people,” Trump said.

The former president’s newest round of threats caps off a campaign with one of the darkest, most menacing closing messages in modern American history. In the last few weeks alone, Trump has doubled down on a pledge to use the military to combat the civilian “enemy within” and mused — in the guise of arguing he was the pro-peace candidate — about how former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his loudest conservative Republican critics, would fare with guns “trained on her face” in a war zone.

This weekend has brought its own slate of bizarre moments. On Sunday, Trump told NBC News that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent post on X about removing fluoride from public water if Trump were to win a second term “sounds OK to me.”

“Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC. “You know, it’s possible.”

And a night earlier in North Carolina, Trump chuckled approvingly at an audience member’s suggestion that Harris worked as a prostitute. After Trump insisted yet again that Harris did not work in a McDonald’s when she was younger, a supporter in Greensboro shouted, “She worked on a corner!”

Trump laughed, paused for a beat, then declared, “This place is amazing.”

As the crowd laughed, he added: “Just remember it’s other people saying it, it’s not me.”

His response to the crude remark underscored how the rot in American political discourse, a long-running spiral, went into overdrive after Trump’s arrival on the presidential campaign trail in 2015. It’s a contrast from seven years earlier, when a supporter of John McCain said during a campaign event that Barack Obama was lying about his identity, claiming, “He’s an Arab,” and the then-GOP nominee took the microphone from her hands, insisting his rival was “a decent family man (and) citizen that just I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.”

Even then, though, Trump was lurking. He would soon emerge as one of the leading proponents of the “birther” conspiracy theory, a racist narrative that said Obama was not born in the US.

In the run-up to this year’s election, Trump has used the former president’s full name — Barack Hussein Obama — in an attempt to demonize him. He frequently mispronounces Harris’ first name, though he has shown before he knows the proper way to say it, and called her a “sh*t vice president.”

At other times, Trump has descended into farce. During a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, last month, he spent some time recalling the late, great golfer Arnold Palmer’s naked body.

“Arnold Palmer was all man, and I say that in all due respect to women, I love women,” Trump said. “This man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros they came out of there, they said, ‘Oh, my God. That’s unbelievable.’”

Trump’s message to — and more often, about — women has also become increasingly bizarre. At a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last week, he told the crowd that his aides had asked him to stop saying he would be the “protector” of American women, in part because they recognized it as inappropriate.

“‘Sir, please don’t say that,’” Trump said he was advised. “Why? I’m president. I want to protect the women of our country. Well, I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not.”

Recent polls have shown the former president trailing Harris with female voters by a significant margin across demographic lines. Neither Trump nor his allies have pushed back on the numbers, instead imploring more men to vote.

“Early vote has been disproportionately female,” said Charlie Kirk, the leader of a right-wing group that Trump has entrusted with managing much of his ground game. “If men stay at home, Kamala is president. It’s that simple.”

Harris has mostly countered Trump’s bleak offerings with promises to bring an end to the tribal clashes that have defined most of the past decade.

“Our democracy doesn’t require us to agree on everything. That’s not the American way,” Harris said during a speech last week from the Ellipse in Washington, DC. “We like a good debate. And the fact that someone disagrees with us, does not make them ‘the enemy from within.’ They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers.”

“It can be easy to forget a simple truth,” she added. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The vice president has also zeroed in on Trump’s attacks on rivals and detractors, including a persistent insistence he wants to use the power of the federal government to punish them. By contrast, Harris likes to say, she is focused on policy, like a push to restore federal abortion rights following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

“On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,” Harris said in Washington. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”

"Mon, 21 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,What Would the Trump Campaign Plans Mean for Social Security?-2024-10-21 - Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,"The Social Security trust funds will be insolvent by Fiscal Year (FY) 2034, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), at which point the law calls for a 23 percent cut in benefits.1 Restoring solvency over the next 75 years would require the equivalent of reducing all future benefits by 24 percent or increasing revenue by 35 percent.

Vice President Kamala Harris has said she would “protect Social Security” and former President Donald Trump has said he would “fight for and protect Social Security.” Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented plans to fix Social Security’s finances despite the looming $16,500 cut facing a typical couple retiring just before insolvency.

In fact, we find President Trump’s campaign proposals would dramatically worsen Social Security’s finances.2

President Trump’s proposals to eliminate taxation of Social Security benefits, end taxes on tips and overtime, impose tariffs, and expand deportations would all widen Social Security’s cash deficits. Under our central estimate, we find that President Trump’s agenda would:

Increase Social Security’s ten-year cash shortfall by $2.3 trillion through FY 2035.

through FY 2035. Advance insolvency by three years , from FY 2034 to FY 2031 – hastening the next President’s insolvency timeline by one-third .

, from FY 2034 to – hastening the next President’s insolvency timeline by . Lead to a 33 percent across-the-board benefit cut in 2035, up from the 23 percent CBO projects under current law.

across-the-board benefit cut in 2035, up from the 23 percent CBO projects under current law. Increase Social Security’s annual shortfall by roughly 50 percent in FY 2035, from 3.6 to 4 percent of payroll.

in FY 2035, from 3.6 to of payroll. Require the equivalent of reducing current law benefits by about one-third or increasing revenue by about one-half to restore 75-year solvency.

Summary Effects of Trump Agenda on Social Security

Low Central High Ten-Year Change in Cash Balance -$1.3 trillion -$2.3 trillion -$2.8 trillion Change in 2035 Balance (% of payroll) -1.0% of payroll -1.8% of payroll -2.2% of payroll Change in 2035 Balance (percent) -28% -50% -61% Year of Insolvency (Current Law = 2034) 2032 2031 2031 Cut in 2035 29% 33% 36%

Note: Years represent fiscal year unless otherwise specified.

US Budget Watch 2024 is a project of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget designed to educate the public on the fiscal impact of presidential candidates’ proposals and platforms. Throughout the election, we will issue policy explainers, fact checks, budget scores, and other analyses. We do not support or oppose any candidate for public office.

Social Security will be only nine years away from insolvency when the next President takes office. If President Trump’s campaign agenda were enacted in full, we estimate it would shrink that window by one-third, to only six years.

Proposals from President Trump that would weaken Social Security’s finances include:

Ending taxation of Social Security benefits, which would eliminate a revenue stream currently used to help finance Social Security.

Ending all taxes on overtime pay and tips, which would reduce payroll tax collection accruing to the Social Security trust funds. 3

Imposing large tariffs on imports, which would either increase cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) through higher inflation or reduce taxable payroll.

Enhancing border security and deporting unauthorized immigrants, which would reduce the number of immigrant workers paying into the Social Security trust funds.

To estimate the effects of these policies on Social Security trust funds, we looked to the high, low, and central estimates in our recent analysis of the Trump campaign plan. We then estimated the impact of each relevant policy on Social Security revenue and/or spending, making additional high and low assumptions where appropriate.4

Under our central estimate, we found these policies would add about $2.3 trillion to Social Security’s cash deficit between FY 2026 and 2035 – which is about 1.8 percent of current law taxable payroll once phased in. This includes $950 billion from ending the income taxation of Social Security benefits, about $900 billion from ending payroll taxes on tips and overtime pay, and roughly $400 billion from changes to tariffs and immigration.

Low Central High End Taxation of Social Security Benefits -$850 -$950 -$950 End Taxes on Overtime and Tips -$150 -$900 -$1,050 Restrict Immigration, Impose Tariffs -$300 -$400 -$750 Total -$1,300> -$2,250 -$2,750 Total, Percent of Payroll (2035) -1.0% -1.8% -2.2%

Under our low-cost scenario, we estimate the Trump campaign’s policies would add $1.3 trillion to Social Security's ten-year cash deficit, and under our high-cost scenario they would add $2.8 trillion. This would represent 1.0 to 2.2 percent of payroll.

As a result of these higher cash deficits, Social Security trust fund reserves would be depleted much faster than under current law. Whereas CBO projects the trust funds to run out of money in FY 2034, we estimate they would run out of money three years earlier under President Trump's agenda, in FY 2031. In other words, the trust funds would be insolvent only six years after the next President takes office instead of nine – reducing the remaining life of the trust fund by one-third.

Insolvency could occur earlier in 2031 or at some point in 2032 under our high- and low-cost scenarios, respectively.

Upon insolvency, the law calls for limiting Social Security spending to its revenue stream, which we've previously estimated would mean a $16,500 cut in annual benefits for a typical dual-income couple retiring in 2033. CBO estimates that benefits would have to be cut by 23 percent by 2035 under current law.

Under President Trump's agenda, we estimate that benefit cut would total 33 percent by 2035, with a range of 29 percent to 36 percent depending on the scenario.

Importantly, this cut somewhat overstates the average effect on beneficiaries, as ending taxation of benefits would increase average after-tax benefits. In our central estimate, real after-tax benefits would be cut by the full 33 percent for about half of beneficiaries – those at lower income levels who don't currently pay taxes on benefits. But they would be cut by closer to 30 percent for the seniors with just enough income to be paying taxes on benefits, 26 percent for a household with income in retirement at about $100,000 per year, and 3 percent for the very highest income households.

Avoiding these cuts would require significant adjustments to Social Security taxes or benefits. Under our central estimate, we find President Trump’s agenda would widen Social Security’s 2035 shortfall by 50 percent. Assuming President Trump's agenda widened the 75-year shortfall by a similar amount, it would grow the solvency gap by more than 40 percent.5 As a result, restoring solvency would require the equivalent of cutting all current law benefits for current and future retirees by roughly one-third or increasing all current law taxes by roughly one-half.

President Trump has said he would close Social Security’s long-term shortfall by increasing drilling for oil and natural gas and by growing the economy. However, we've shown that increased energy exploration is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on Social Security – even if the gains were deposited into the trust fund. We've also shown that it would require unrealistically fast economic growth to close Social Security’s existing long-term funding gap.

Faster growth can reduce Social Security’s shortfall. But based on available analyses and understanding the effects of President Trump’s agenda on the national debt, it is unlikely his plans would significantly boost the size of the economy, and many estimates find his plans would reduce long-term output.

Throughout the 2024 presidential election cycle, US Budget Watch 2024 will bring information and accountability to the campaign by analyzing candidates’ proposals, fact-checking their claims, and scoring the fiscal cost of their agendas.

By injecting an impartial, fact-based approach into the national conversation, US Budget Watch 2024 will help voters better understand the nuances of the candidates’ policy proposals and what they would mean for the country’s economic and fiscal future.

You can find more US Budget Watch 2024 content here.

1 For consistency with our analysis of the Trump campaign plan, we use CBO’s estimate of the theoretically combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust funds, which are projected to run out of reserves in Fiscal Year 2034. This differs from the Social Security Trustees, which estimate theoretically combined trust fund depletion in calendar year 2035 and depletion of the old-age fund in 2033.

2 The Harris campaign’s proposals would not have large effects on Social Security trust fund solvency. Increased border security and the extension of some parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would likely expand Social Security’s deficits by reducing revenue collection from payroll taxes and taxation of benefits. At the same time, increases in the minimum wage and various tax compliance measures would likely reduce Social Security’s deficits by boosting payroll tax collection. On net, these changes are likely to modestly increase ten-year deficits and advance insolvency by several weeks or months.

3 GOP vice presidential nominee Senator JD Vance (R-OH) has explicitly said the “no taxes on overtime” policy would apply to payroll taxes. We assume the “no taxes on tips” policy will as well, except in our low-cost estimate that assumes it only applies to income taxes.

4 We estimate the total effect of President Trump’s agenda on Social Security’s cash deficits by summing the lost income tax revenue dedicated to the Social Security trust fund from eliminating taxes on benefits, the lost payroll tax revenue from ending taxes on tips and overtime, the off-budget effects of lower payroll tax revenue and Social Security benefits from restricting immigration and deporting unauthorized immigrants, and the potential effects of President Trump’s tariffs on Social Security’s revenue and costs. Our low-, central, and high-cost estimates are based on the underlying policies assumed in our report The Fiscal Impact of the Harris and Trump Campaign Plans. For eliminating Social Security’s taxation of benefits, our central and high-cost scenarios assume this revenue source is zeroed out, while our low-cost scenario assumes some is recovered through generous dynamic feedback (specifically that each dollar of tax cuts leads to a dollar of additional earnings). Our central and high-cost scenarios also calculate the Social Security payroll tax loss from ending taxes on tips and overtime under different parameters, while our low-cost scenario assumes only overtime is exempt from the payroll tax (and the exemption is limited to ten hours per month). For immigration, our low-cost estimate assumes no loss, our central estimate assumes half the conventionally-scored off-budget gains from the recent surge in immigration are reversed, while our high-cost estimate assumes all the conventional off-budget gains are reversed, along with imputed off-budget gains from macro-dynamic effects. For President Trump’s proposed tariffs, our low-cost estimate assumes a standard ‘payroll tax offset’ as ordinarily scored by CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation; our high-cost estimate assumes the money directly paid in tariffs is incorporated into consumer prices and thus leads to higher Social Security benefits via a larger cost-of-living adjustment after the first year (and slightly smaller COLAs thereafter); and our central estimate assumes a 50/50 combination of these approaches. This approach does not account for possible additional inflationary effects due to higher prices charged by domestic industries or increases in inflation expectations, as these higher prices would likely flow through to higher incomes as well and thus boost payroll tax revenue as well as programmatic costs.

"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Elon Musk exerts deepening influence on Donald Trump’s presidential transition - CNN,"CNN —

Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has been brimming in the last 48 hours with two kinds of people: those angling for a job in the president-elect’s incoming administration, and those trying to influence him into hiring their picks for the top spots.

But the one person who has loomed over it all and has exerted a great deal of influence is Elon Musk, according to multiple sources. The tech billionaire has been seen at the resort in Palm Beach, Florida, almost every day since Trump won the election last week, dining with him on the patio some evenings and hanging out with his family Sunday at the golf course.

Musk has been in the room when multiple world leaders have phoned Trump, and he’s weighed in on staffing decisions, with the SpaceX and Tesla CEO even making clear his preference for certain roles.

In one instance, Musk was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called to congratulate the president-elect the day after the election, according to a source briefed on the call. Trump put the call on speaker, and Zelensky thanked Musk for his help providing communications to Ukraine through the billionaire’s Starlink internet service.

On Sunday, Musk waded into the GOP Senate leadership fight, endorsing Sen. Rick Scott after the Florida Republican swiftly backed Trump’s demand that anyone vying to be leader support recess appointments for his nominees — a way for presidents to attempt to bypass Congress that Senate Democrats could essentially block.

Musk is not only close to Trump but also with his transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick — the billionaire CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald who is leading the personnel side of the transition.

Sources have described Trump as enamored with Musk.

“We have to protect our geniuses, we don’t have that many of them,” the president-elect said during his victory speech early Wednesday morning.

While Musk himself is not formally expected to take a position in Trump’s administration, he doesn’t really need to, one source said, noting the X owner is having just as much influence from the outside.

While Trump and Musk had publicly pitched the latter leading an efficiency commission to slash spending inside the federal government, CNN reported Thursday that a source familiar with the conversations around Musk said it seemed unlikely he would even want a full-time government position, given what that would mean for his role in the companies he helms.

Instead, it seemed more plausible that Musk would be appointed to a blue-ribbon committee, where he would still have enormous access but would not be subject to government ethics rules, which would require him to divest or put assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest.

As of mid-October, Musk had donated nearly $119 million to a political action committee he set up to support Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings. He also appeared with Trump at rallies and hosted a friendly interview with him on X, his social media platform.

Musk’s big bet on Trump paid near-immediate dividends. The day after the election, investors sent shares of Tesla up nearly 15%. That lifted the value of the 411 million shares that Musk owns outright by more than $15 billion and marked a two-year high for Tesla shares as a whole.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,How Trump pulled off an incredible comeback - BBC.com,"How Trump pulled off an incredible comeback

AP

This is surely the most dramatic comeback in US political history. Four years after leaving the White House, Donald Trump is set to move back in, after millions of Americans voted to give him a second chance. The election campaign was one for the history books: he survived two assassination attempts and his original opponent President Joe Biden dropped out just months before election day. Although final votes are still being counted, the majority of Americans in key battleground states chose to vote for him, with many citing the economy and immigration as a chief concern.

AP

His triumph comes after a spectacular fall. He refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden, and his role in trying to overturn the election results to stay in office is still being scrutinised today.

He faces charges for allegedly inciting the violent attack on the US Capitol on the 6 January 2021. And he will also make history as the first sitting president to have been convicted of a felony, after being found guilty of falsifying business records. It’s not hard to see why he is a deeply polarising figure. Throughout the campaign, Trump used incendiary rhetoric – making crass jokes and threatening vengeance against his political enemies.

His message on the economy touched a chord

Few people have a middle ground when it comes to Trump. Most of the voters I spoke to during the course of this campaign said they wished he would “shut his potty mouth” – but they were able to look past it. Instead, they focused on the question he asked at every rally. “Are you better off now than you were two years ago?” So many people who voted for Donald Trump told me again and again that they felt the economy was much better when he was in office and they were sick of trying to make ends meet. Although much of the cause of inflation was due to outside forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they blamed the outgoing administration. Voters were also deeply concerned about illegal immigration which had reached record levels under Biden. They usually didn’t express racist views or believe that migrants were eating people’s pets, as Trump and his supporters had claimed. They just wanted much stronger border enforcement.

'America first' for a second Trump term

“America first” was another one of Trump’s slogans that really seemed to strike a chord with voters. All over the country I heard people – on the left and right - complaining about billions of dollars being spent on supporting Ukraine when they thought that money would be much better spent at home. In the end, they just couldn’t vote for Harris, who served as Biden’s vice-president for four years. They believed it would be more of the same, and they wanted change.

It is perhaps one of the ironies of this election that the candidate who most represented change was himself in power just four years ago. But there are several differences between then and now. When he first came into power in 2016, he was a political outsider, and, at least for a while, he surrounded himself with veteran political advisers and staff who showed him the ropes and constrained his actions. Now he doesn’t seem that interested in playing by the rules of the game. Many of these same advisers and staff have spoken out – calling him a “liar”, a “fascist” and “unfit”. They have cautioned that if he surrounds himself with loyalists, which he is expected to do, that there will be no one to restrain him from his more extreme ideas. When he left office, he faced a litany of criminal charges related to his role in the Capitol riots, how he handled documents pertaining to national security, and hush money payments to a porn star.

AFP

But since the Supreme Court ruled that the president has total immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, it will be an uphill battle for any prosecutor to charge him during the next administration. And as president, he could instruct his justice department to drop the federal charges against him relating to the 6 January riots so he doesn’t have to worry about a jail sentence. At the same time, he could pardon hundreds of people sentenced to prison for their part in the Capitol Riots.

In the end, voters were presented with two versions of America. Donald Trump told them that their country was a failing nation that only he could Make Great Again. Meanwhile, Harris cautioned that if Trump was elected, American democracy itself would face an existential threat. That remains to be seen. But what Trump said himself during the campaign has not exactly assuaged people’s fears.

Reuters

He has heaped praise on authoritarian leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, whom he said were “at the top of their game, whether you like it or not”. He has talked about trying to silence critics in the press. Just days before the election, he also made comments that implied he wouldn’t mind if members of the media were killed. And he has continued to amplify conspiracy theories and unfounded claims of election fraud – even though the election ultimately led to his victory. Now, voters will find how much of what he said during the campaign was just loose talk - “Trump being Trump”. And remember: it’s not just Americans who have to confront the reality of a second Trump term. The rest of the world will now discover what “America First” really means. From the global economic consequences of 20% tariffs that he has proposed on US imports to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that he has vowed to end – regardless of which side wins. Donald Trump did not manage to implement all of his plans in his first term. Now with a second mandate and significantly less encumbered, America, and the world, will see what he can really do.",How Trump pulled off an incredible comeback  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2818j7rko
"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Trump and Vance make anti-transgender attacks central to their campaign's closing argument - The Associated Press,"ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump has made his opposition to transgender rights central to his closing argument before Election Day, using demeaning language and misrepresentations to paint an exceedingly narrow slice of the U.S. population as a threat to national identity.

The former president and Republican nominee’s campaign and aligned political action committees have spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising that attacks Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris for her previous statements supporting transgender rights.

His rally speeches now feature a spoof video mocking trans people and their place in the U.S. military. The montage, interspersed with clips of the Vietnam War movie “Full Metal Jacket,” typically draws loud boos at his rallies, as do Trump’s false claims about female athletes and his mocking impression of what he says is a trans woman lifting weights.

“We will get ... transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports,” Trump said at his recent Madison Square Garden rally, drawing an approving roar from the crowd of 20,000-plus. He regularly claims, falsely, that “your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation” changing their sex.

Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, alleged Thursday that white teenagers in the “middle class or upper-middle class” can identify as transgender to more easily get into elite universities.

What to know about Trump’s second term:

Staffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.

“Is there a dynamic that’s going on where if you become trans, that’s the way to reject your white privilege?” Vance told podcaster Joe Rogan, citing conservative anger about affirmative action and other programs geared toward historically disenfranchised groups. “That’s the only social signifier,” Vance continued, “the only one that is available in the hyper-woke mindset, is if you become gender nonbinary.”

While often overshadowed by his emphasis on migrants, Trump’s broadsides against LGBTQ people have seemed to grow more frequent and ominous in the campaign’s final days, intended both to stir his core supporters and coax votes from more moderate voters who may not mesh with Trump on other matters. It’s part of an overall campaign in which Trump has pushed his own brand of hyper-masculinity, most recently referring several times to CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who is gay, by a woman’s name, “Allison Cooper.”

Harris has largely ignored Trump’s attacks but has pushed back on his characterization of her stances, noting that federal policy giving U.S. military personnel access to gender-affirming medical care and transgender surgery was in place during Trump’s presidency.

“I will follow the law,” Harris said in a Fox News interview on Oct. 17. “And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now. It’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system.”

On “The Breakfast Club” podcast earlier this week, she added that Trump was “living in a glass house” with his attacks. She compared the number of people involved: She said two U.S. service members have sought transgender surgery, while millions of people could be stripped of their health insurance if Trump and Republicans succeed in their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Harris’ campaign aides, meanwhile, see Trump’s approach as appealing only to hardline supporters already behind him, thus ceding issues, especially the economy, that resonate with many more voters who are not interested in another culture war battle.

Polling suggests a divided electorate on transgender rights. About half of Americans, 51%, say changing one’s gender is morally wrong, according to a Gallup poll from May. About 7 in 10 Americans say transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that match their birth gender, according to a 2023 Gallup poll. Yet about 6 in 10 Americans oppose laws that ban treatments and medical procedures that help transgender individuals align with their gender identity, according to a Gallup poll from May. About one-third favor such bans.

Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, express concerns over what a second Trump administration would mean for LGBTQ rights, and say his campaign messaging already threatens the security of transgender people, regardless of who prevails.

Trump has vowed to target transgender people if elected. He has said he would ask Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and to ban hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors in all 50 states.

Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, said Trump’s approach attacks “vulnerable people” who make up about 1% of the population “and already are marginalized” by much of society.

“Why are we debating trans people’s medical care? Because there’s a lack of understanding, and there’s a lack of humanizing about who trans people are,” Ellis said. “It’s not easy to be transgender, to wake up every day in a body that might not fit who you are, and instead of having empathy, they’re met with hostility. That’s the culture Trump is creating.”

Writer and activist Charlotte Clymer added on the social media platform X: “It really ... sucks to watch any sports event as a trans person right now because of the Trump commercials, and I just need everyone to know that: yes, we do see the ads, and it’s demoralizing to know this entire subset of people sees us as subhuman.”

Indeed, Trump’s campaign has since Sept. 1 spent about $35 million airing three ads based on statements Harris made in 2019 as a candidate for Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination. Clips show Harris affirming her support for federal policies that allow federal prisoners access to medical care including gender-affirming hormone treatments and, potentially, transgender surgery.

“It sounds insane because it is insane,” the announcer states in an ad that, as of Thursday, had aired almost 28,000 times across presidential battlegrounds and national television. “Kamala’s agenda is ‘they-them,’ not you,’” the ad concludes, referring to non-gender-specific pronouns.

Harris, in her 2019 presidential campaign, wrote in an ACLU questionnaire, “I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained.”

She also worked as California attorney general to grant access to such care for state prisoners. But Harris is correct in noting that similar federal policies were in place under Trump’s presidency, both for immigrant detainees and federal prisoners.

At Trump’s rallies, he often addresses LGBTQ issues with generalizations and emotional appeals. He routinely blasts U.S. military leaders for being “woke,” blaming Harris and President Joe Biden.

The spoof video that is played on screens at Trump’s rallies alternates between scenes of intense military training, sometimes with drill sergeants yelling at troops, and scenes depicting what are supposed to be LGBTQ members of the military, each displaying exaggerated feminine affects. The latter scenes, the video states, reflect the U.S. military under Biden and Harris.

By the time Trump takes the stage, multiple speakers have primed the audience on the issue.

“We’re in the middle of a national identity crisis. Faith in God, patriotism, hard work, family -- these things have disappeared only to be replaced by ‘wokeism’ and transgenderism” and other philosophies, said former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy at Madison Square Garden. “These are symptoms of a deeper void of purpose and meaning in our country, and right now we need to step up and fill that void with our own vision.”

"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 16:14:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Manhattan DA agrees to postpone Donald Trump’s sentencing in hush money case but opposes dismissal - CNN,"CNN —

The Manhattan district attorney’s office said Tuesday it would agree to postpone Donald Trump’s sentencing in his hush money case to give prosecutors time to litigate the president-elect’s expected motion to dismiss the case.

In a letter to Judge Juan Merchan, the district attorney’s office also acknowledged that Trump is not likely to be sentenced “until after the end of Defendant’s upcoming presidential term.” But the DA says Trump’s felony conviction should stand.

A source close to the district attorney’s office said it is open to a four year pause of the case.

The developments cap a historic and unprecedented turnaround for Trump’s legal and political fate. One year ago, Trump was facing four separate indictments. Now, as he prepares to retake the White House, the strategy of Trump’s lawyers to try to push all of his cases beyond the 2024 election has proved wildly successful, with the two federal cases about to be wound down, the Georgia state case long dormant and the New York case poised to end indefinitely without a sentence.

Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records over payments made to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.)

In the letter to Merchan, the Manhattan district attorney argued the judge should not dismiss Trump’s conviction.

“No current law establishes that a president’s temporary immunity from prosecution requires dismissal of a post-trial criminal proceeding that was initiated at a time when the defendant was not immune from criminal prosecution and that is based on official conduct for which the defendant is also not immune,” the district attorney’s office wrote.

In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the filing “a total and definitive victory for President Trump.”

Merchan had been set to rule last week on whether to overturn the conviction based on this summer’s US Supreme Court decision that Trump should receive broad immunity for official acts during his time in office and that official acts can’t be used as evidence in a criminal trial.

But the district attorney’s office acknowledged the “unprecedented circumstances” of Trump’s election as president, and Merchan’s ruling was postponed.

Trump’s lawyers have argued the conviction should be tossed both because of the presidential immunity decision and because he’s about to return to the White House.

“The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern,” Trump attorney Emil Bove wrote in emails exchanged with the court and the district attorney’s office this month. Trump has picked Bove to fill a high-ranking Justice Department spot in his new administration.

Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former prosecutor, said Tuesday that the postponement of Trump’s sentencing was an inevitable outcome of his election.

“The clock ran out,” Honig said. “We like to say no person is above the law in this country, but the fact is one person largely is, and that’s the president, because of the immunity ruling and because of the DOJ policy” that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted.

“That’s just sort of the cold, hard reality of the way our system works,” he added.

Trump seeks to dismiss case

In a two-page letter docketed Wednesday, Trump defense attorney and deputy attorney general selection Todd Blanche argues that Trump’s reelection “mandates” dismissal of the case writing, “Just as a sitting President is completely immune from any criminal process, so too is President Trump as President-elect.”

Trump’s lawyers argue that continuing with this case would be “uniquely destabilizing” and “hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.”

His lawyers are asking the court to give them until December 20 to file a motion to dismiss. The Manhattan DA had asked for a deadline of December 9, but Trump’s lawyers say they want additional time so they can see “positions taken by DOJ in the federal case.” Special counsel Jack Smith has said he will put forth a plan to wind down the two federal cases he has brought against Trump by December 2.

“On November 5, 2024, the Nation’s People issued a mandate that supersedes the political motivations of DANY’s ‘People.’ This case must be immediately dismissed,” the letter states.

Sentencing was delayed twice before election

Trump was indicted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg last spring, the first of four indictments he would face in 2023.

It would ultimately be the only case against Trump to go to trial: The federal election subversion case was delayed indefinitely by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling; a Trump-appointed federal judge dismissed the classified documents case; and the Georgia case has languished amid a push from Trump and his co-defendants to have the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case.

A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts after a two-month trial.

But Trump’s sentencing, originally scheduled for July, was delayed twice after the Supreme Court’s immunity decision prompted Trump’s lawyers to file a motion to vacate the conviction. That effort, along with other tactics, including seeking to move the case into federal court, further delayed the proceedings and prompted Merchan to push the sentencing decision and a ruling on immunity until after the November election.

Trump’s lawyers have argued the conviction should be tossed because the district attorney’s office relied on evidence related to Trump’s official acts as president during his first term, which should not have been presented to the jury at trial.

Bragg’s office has said Trump’s conviction should stand and that the evidence presented at trial was “overwhelming.”

CNN —

While President Joe Biden bragged about picking the most diverse Cabinet in history, one that he said “looks like America,” President-elect Donald Trump is looking for TV experience.

While Trump’s picks so far mostly lack in racial or gender diversity – there are a handful of women and one Latino, for example, but no Black Americans selected yet – they do reach outside of the normal stable of likely government officials, in keeping with Trump’s goal of shaking up Washington.

It shouldn’t necessarily be a shock from the former president who likes to see attractive people defend him on TV and who became famous in New York tabloids and a reality show. But it’s striking nonetheless to see the number of TV and entertainment personalities Trump is tapping for his second term.

The Cabinet is still taking shape, and key roles like Treasury secretary have not been filled. Plus, not all of his Fox News picks are for Cabinet roles. The latest development is that Trump is reportedly eyeing Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent turned right-wing podcaster who left his job hosting a Fox News show in 2023, as Secret Service director. There are others also in contention for the position.

The most notable instance of the made-for-TV Cabinet is Trump’s announcement of his choice for defense secretary: Pete Hegseth, a Fox News weekend host with a great physique and hair, whose tattoos drove him from the Army National Guard.

Hegseth has big ideas for how to reform the military, starting with the firing of some generals, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the ending of diversity programs in the military. He also wants women out of combat roles, something that could be contested by Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for the non-Cabinet role of director of national intelligence, who served in a field medical unit during the US war in Iraq and is still an Army reservist.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, who most people know as Dr. Oz, is a cardiothoracic surgeon who turned guest appearances on Oprah Winfrey’s show into his own daytime career. He left that to run unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2022. Days before the announcement of his appointment, he was selling vitamin supplements online.

Trump wants Oz to take over the most important agency most Americans may never have heard of: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees health insurance coverage for more than 160 million Americans.

Mike Huckabee was the governor of Arkansas, a position now held by his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as Trump’s press secretary during his first term. In between failed bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016, Huckabee hosted a show on Fox News.

More recently, he’s had a show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian outlet. He’ll bring an evangelical worldview to Jerusalem, where Trump moved the US embassy, if confirmed as US ambassador to Israel. Trump’s choice is controversial for anyone who envisions a two-state solution in the Middle East, since Huckabee once said there’s “no such thing as a Palestinian.”

Long before Sean Duffy was a congressman from Wisconsin, he was a contestant on MTV’s “The Real World: Boston,” an early part of the reality TV world once also inhabited by Trump.

Duffy met his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on the set of a spinoff, “Road Rules: All Stars.” Now, she’s a co-host on “Fox & Friends Weekend,” where she worked for years with Hegseth. Duffy is leaving his post-Congress role as a co-host on Fox Business now that he’s been tapped by Trump to serve as Transportation secretary, in charge of the nation’s highway and rail systems, airways and seaports.

Gabbard, a former House representative, left the Democratic Party, but along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she’s one of two former Democratic presidential candidates among Trump’s administration picks. She has appeared hundreds of times on Fox News. More recently, she signed on to do a series of documentary-style videos on Elon Musk’s X.

As Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, Gabbard has drawn criticism for her defense of Russia and Syria in the name of her anti-war ideals. Hillary Clinton once said she thought Russians were “grooming” Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate.

A Fox contributor to be ‘border czar’

Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be in charge of coordinating immigration policy for Trump. By serving as “border czar,” Homan won’t have to face Senate confirmation.

Homan was actually the first of Trump’s picks to be announced from the Fox News orbit. CNN’s Brian Stelter wrote at the time:

While the revolving door between television and government is a bipartisan and often-criticized phenomenon, it never stopped spinning during Trump’s first term in office. Between 2017 and 2020, there were 20 known cases of Fox-to-Trump moves, including Anthony Scaramucci, Richard Grenell, Heather Nauert, Morgan Ortagus, and Bill Shine.

An anti-mainstream conspiracy theorist and author to oversee health policy

Trump has picked Kennedy to be the next Health and Human Services secretary. There’s been a steep drop in faith among Republicans in particular in the need for vaccines. Say what you want about Kennedy’s interesting-sounding ideas about making American food less processed and healthier. Appreciate the toned body he showed off in shirtless workouts. But it’s impossible to get past the vaccine skeptic part of him that pushes unfounded theories.

He wrote a book full of unfounded conspiracy theories attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci and alleging the country’s former top infectious disease doctor was in league with Bill Gates and pharmaceutical companies to undermine public health. It was a New York Times bestseller. Which, as CNN’s Peter Bergen noted in an interview with Kennedy, totally undermines his claim that he was being silenced – a frequent claim of the stars of anti-mainstream media.

"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Some Arab Americans who voted for Trump say they are concerned about his picks for key positions - PBS NewsHour,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Just a week after winning several of the nation’s largest Arab-majority cities, President-elect Donald Trump has filled top administration posts with staunch Israel supporters, including an ambassador to Israel who has claimed “there is no such thing as Palestinians.”

Meanwhile, the two Trump advisers who led his outreach to Arab Americans have not secured positions in the administration yet.

The selections have prompted mixed reactions among Arab Americans and Muslims in Michigan, which went for Trump along with all six other battleground states. Some noted Trump’s longstanding support for Israel and said their vote against Vice President Kamala Harris was not necessarily an endorsement of him. Others who openly supported him say he will be the final decisionmaker on policy and hope he will keep his promise of achieving an end to the conflicts in the Middle East.

READ MORE: Trump breaks Republican losing streak in nation’s largest majority-Arab city

Albert Abbas, a Lebanese American leader whose brother owns the Dearborn, Michigan, restaurant Trump visited in the campaign’s final days, stood beside the former president during that visit and spoke in support of him.

Now, Abbas says it’s “too early” to judge Trump and that “we all need to take a deep breath, take a step back and let him do the work that he needs to do to to achieve this peace.”

“I just want you to think about what the alternative was,” said Abbas, referring to the current administration’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon. He added, “What did you expect from myself or many members of the community to do?”

Beyond promising peace in the Middle East, Trump has offered few concrete details on how he plans to achieve it. His transition team did not respond to a request for comment.

Throughout the campaign, his surrogates often focused more on criticizing Harris than outlining his agenda. And visuals of the conflict — with tens of thousands of deaths collectively in Gaza and Lebanon — stirred anger among many in Arab and Muslim communities about President Joe Biden and Harris’ backing of Israel.

Amin Hashmi, a Pakistani American in Michigan who voted for Trump, urged him to stay true to his campaign commitments to bring peace.

“I am disappointed but not surprised,” said Hashmi, who urged Trump to “keep the promise you made to the people of Arab descent in Michigan.”

Trump picks what pro-Israel conservatives call a ‘dream team’

Those in the community with concerns have specifically pointed to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, nominated as Trump’s ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has consistently rejected the idea of a Palestinian state in territories seized by Israel, strongly supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposed a two-state solution, claiming “there really isn’t such a thing” as Palestinians in referring to the descendants of people who lived in Palestine before the establishment of Israel.

While Huckabee has sparked the most concern among community members, other Trump Cabinet picks have strongly spoken in Israel’s favor as it targets Hamas following the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which it killed 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds more as hostage.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, nominated for secretary of state, has opposed a ceasefire in the war, stating that he wants Israel to “destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.”

Trump’s pick to be his ambassador to the United Nations, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, led the questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on campuses. She has also opposed funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees aid to Gaza.

Pete Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran and Fox News host, was chosen by Trump to head the Department of Defense. Hegseth has publicly opposed the two-state solution and advocated for rebuilding a biblical Jewish temple on the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites.

The Republican Jewish Coalition, which organized for Trump in Michigan, has been outspoken in its support for many of Trump’s Cabinet picks. Sam Markstein, the group’s political director, described the proposed lineup as a “pro-Israel dream team,” adding that “folks are giddy about the picks.” He praised Trump’s pro-Israel record as “second to nobody.”

“The days of this mealymouthed, trying to have support in both camps of this issue are over,” Markstein said. “The way to secure the region is peace through strength, and that means no daylight between Israel and the United States.”

No roles yet for key figures in Trump’s Arab American outreach

Among the reasons some Arab American voters supported Trump was that they believed his prominent supporters would be key in the next administration.

Massad Boulos, a Lebanese businessman and father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany, led efforts to engage the Arab American community, organizing dozens of meetings across Michigan and other areas with large Arab populations. Some sessions also featured Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence, who was well-regarded by those who met with him.

Neither Boulos nor Grenell has been tapped yet for the coming administration, though Grenell was once considered a potential secretary of state before Rubio was selected. Boulos declined to comment and Grenell did not respond to a request for comment.

“Some people expected Trump to be different and thought Massad would play a significant role,” said Osama Siblani, publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, which declined to endorse a candidate in the presidential race.

Siblani himself turned down a suggested meeting with Trump after the non-endorsement announcement.

“But now people are coming to us and saying, ‘Look what you’ve done,’” Siblani said. “We had a choice between someone actively shooting and killing you and someone threatening to do so. We had to punish the person who was shooting and killing us at the time.”

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 15:27:15 GMT",Donald Trump,Why Does No One Understand the Real Reason Trump Won? - The New Republic,"At this point in a presidential campaign, establishing momentum becomes important—having the look of a winner. As I’ve often said, the swing voters who’ll decide the election don’t have strong political allegiances; these are people who view politics, as Wisconsin Democratic chairman Ben Wikler recently said, the way we political-junkie types view Olympic sports—we know they exist, and we pay attention for a brief period every four years, and that’s it. We choose to root for non-American Olympic athletes based on a bunch of emotional and nonrational factors—whether we have warm or cool feelings toward their country, whether we like the way they carry themselves, the way they smile—and maybe most of all, whether they have a shot at winning. In the 100-meter dash, we’re more likely to cheer for the Jamaican who has a real chance of medaling than the guy from Norway or whatever; nothing against Norway.

So campaigns need to do things in the closing weeks to communicate momentum and exude winner-ness. Having an unexpected rally at an unexpected and famous place qualifies. It shakes things up a little. It dominates, or at least figures prominently into, the cable news menu for probably four days—two before, the day of, and one day after. And if Trump can actually fill the place, or come close, that too communicates energy.

Harris came out of the blocks with a massive burst of energy, which has certainly stalled to some extent. Heading into these final three weeks, she needs to create some new buzz. Simply doing more events will help. She just hasn’t been on the trail enough. She needs to show that she can still draw the thousands she was drawing in August. A new proposal or two will help. It’s hard to say how much policy matters at this point, especially against an opponent who has contempt for policy, but it can’t hurt. Her proposal on long-term home care this week was actually pretty important—it’s a huge hole in Medicare and would make a difference in millions of people’s lives.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,When will Trump take office as president? Here's when he'll officially be sworn in - CBS News,"When will Donald Trump be sworn into office?

President-elect Donald Trump is the projected winner of the 2024 election, besting Vice President Kamala Harris for the highest office in the land.

CBS News projected the former president will win multiple battleground states. As of Wednesday morning, Trump was also ahead in the popular vote, something that eluded him in 2016.

Although Trump was projected the winner early Wednesday, Nov. 6, it will be several months before Trump takes office. Here's what to know about when he will be sworn in.

When will Trump be sworn in?

President-elect Trump will be sworn in at his inauguration. The presidential inauguration is always held on Jan. 20, as specified by the Constitution's 20th Amendment.

The president-elect becomes the president immediately after being sworn in. The new president typically moves into the White House after the ceremony.

Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine before Inauguration Day, but he has no presidential powers before being sworn in. He has made a number of promises for his presidency, including ending ObamaCare and beginning mass deportations of migrants. In his closing message the night before Election Day, Trump promised greatness if he won.

""After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,"" Trump said. ""You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.""

What happens on Inauguration Day?

The inauguration is about two and a half months after Election Day. It begins with a procession to the Capitol, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.

The vice president recites his oath of office and is sworn in first. Around noon, the president recites his own oath of office and is sworn in.

Then, the president gives an inaugural address. The speech usually outlines a president's vision and goals for their term. At his first inauguration, Trump said he was planning on ""transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American people.""

After the speech, the previous president makes an honorary departure from the Capitol. That's followed by a signing ceremony, where the new president signs their first official actions. That's followed by a number of ceremonies.

The final traditional event of the inauguration is the pass-in review, when the president and vice president review military troops before leading a procession of ceremonial military regiments, citizens' groups, floats and marching bands from the Capitol to the White House.

What are the oaths of office?

The president-elect recites this oath, as required by the U.S. Constitution, ahead of being sworn in, according to the Congressional committee:

""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

The vice presidential oath of office is the same as the vow taken by senators, representatives, and other federal employees, according to the Congressional committee:

""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.""",When will Trump take office as president?

Staff Writer

Let me make something clear: Trump supporters are not inherently bigoted. While the last few months have shown very ugly sides of MAGA rhetoric, as I discussed in another piece two months ago about the cat-eating hoax, there are still many reasons one would’ve voted for Trump, and the last thing I want to do is lump all of his supporters into one reason.

Still, it’s hard to comprehend how America, as a collective nation, chose Trump as their president again. And it’s not the idea of him being president as much as it is the idea of him winning. The Harris campaign, while not perfect, did the best they could with what they had, while the Trump campaign had everything going against it. Criminal charges, national embarrassments, and the fear of an authoritarian presidency looming over the election set the stage for a Harris victory.

But then a massive rightward shift hit America, one no campaign could’ve prepared for. Trying to understand this, I turned to the reactions from online right-wingers and saw multiple of them celebrate the idea of putting women who were at the front of the Harris campaign in their place. It hit me right there that the rightward shift in our country is the result of open misogyny and toxic masculinity.

I know I’d seem like a stereotypical “Social Justice Warrior (SJW)” who hates masculine men and feminine women, but that’s because the term “toxic masculinity” is misleading. It has nothing to do with gender expression, but rather the subjugation of women and enforcement of gender roles. We’ve seen an increase in online influencers promoting an “alpha male” mindset that views women as beneath them and queer people as degenerates.

You might’ve heard of some of these people: Andrew Tate, Joe Rogan, Fresh and Fit. They’re known as the “Manosphere,” and they prey on isolated, impressionable young men who are without active male influences in their lives. They’re less likely to connect to female influences, so the manosphere fills the role of a male influence, taking advantage of a parasocial relationship to feed misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and even racism in some cases.

There’s a lot of variation and disagreement, but no matter what a manosphere influencer may preach, they all share the same goal: gradually ending feminism and reinstating gender roles in society. And gradually it is, as the manosphere has been active since 2014 with GamerGate, where a false claim about game developer Zoe Quinn led to her and many other women in the video game industry being harassed and threatened. While the harassment died quickly, SJWs became a prominent target for young conservatives like Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk, elevating the misogynistic rhetoric of Donald Trump to the White House.

Think about how the two people Trump defeated were both women. It isn’t rocket science to believe that the idea of a woman in the country’s highest office sparks fear and disgust in many men. Tell me, would the country constantly slutshaming women elect one president? And don’t get me started on Elon Musk, who promoted ideas that “women and low t men” can’t think freely as he turned Twitter into a stomping ground for the manosphere to spread monetized lies. Now he’s being considered for Trump’s cabinet.

There are other things that could be responsible. The Great Recession spawned populism on both sides of the political spectrum, while COVID-19 negatively impacted Trump’s 2020 chances and distorted perceptions of his term that helped him in 2024. But the manosphere wins regardless and can continue to gain the widespread sexism in society. It’s a societal issue that the Manosphere benefits from, and anyone on its opposing end needs to counter its influence on society before it becomes stronger.",Donald Trump didn’t win.

"Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,How Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to dispute the election results – again - CNN,"CNN —

Donald Trump is re-using his 2020 playbook to baselessly claim the 2024 election is being stolen from him and is being joined by allies with big megaphones amplifying his falsehoods ahead of Election Day.

Trump has made repeated false claims that Democrats are cheating in the election, and he’s twisted isolated problems with voting leading up to Election Day, all in an effort to prime his supporters to falsely believe the election is not legitimate if he loses.

This includes saying voting by noncitizens is a widespread problem. He’s claimed there’s no verification for overseas or military ballots. He’s claimed election officials are using early voting to commit fraud. He’s claimed that massive swaths of mail-in ballots are illegitimate, even as he’s encouraged his supporters to use mail voting this time around.

Most importantly, Trump has claimed that the only way Vice President Kamala Harris can win the election is by cheating.

The claims are baseless.

“It’s unfortunate that he sees his path back to the White House as denigrating a basic American institution like elections,” said Ben Ginsberg, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign attorney who has served as general counsel for several previous GOP nominees. “If you’re just starting to pay attention to this, the claims that you’re hearing in 2024 about the election system not being reliable is extraordinarily similar to what he and his supporters were saying in 2020.”

In 2020, Trump lost a close election, and then spent two months trying to overturn the result. In 2024, with polls signaling a razor-thin election in seven battleground states, election officials are bracing for another firehose of misinformation about the result – especially if the election hinges on the results of hundreds of ballots in one or two states.

Election experts say that despite the viral and hyperbolic claims, the vast majority of voters will almost assuredly experience a swift and uneventful experience whenever they vote, whether it’s through early voting, vote-by-mail or on Election Day.

As early voting has gotten underway, many local and state officials are showing they intend to proactively knock down falsehoods about the election that spread like wildfire on social media.

Voter fraud is rare, but when it does happen, it is usually caught thanks to the layers of safeguards built into voting processes, according to nonpartisan election experts.

“It’s really useful to remind people in this time of heightened anxiety, all the way around, that they’re still in charge (to decide the election outcome),” said Justin Levitt, a CNN contributor and election law expert at Loyola Law School who served as a voting rights adviser in the Biden White House.

Video Ad Feedback ‘A real fear that the bottom has started to fall out’: Journalist on recent mood inside Trump campaign 05:58 - Source: CNN

“There’s a ton of noise out there right now. If this election is more than a 537-vote margin in any of the swing states, none of the noise will matter,” Levitt added, referencing the margin in Florida during the disputed 2000 presidential election.

Still, that hasn’t always stopped conspiracy theories from spreading on social media – including from Elon Musk, the CEO of X, who has poured tens of millions of dollars into boosting Trump’s campaign. Election officials warn they’re outmatched and struggling to combat the wave of falsehoods coming from Musk and his platform.

An intense focus on Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania could be the state where the 2024 campaign is decided, and it’s become ground zero for both legal fights over voting rules – and the spread of misinformation.

Trump has already claimed without evidence that his opponents are cheating in the state, both on his social media and at campaign rallies. At a Tuesday rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Trump claimed that the discovery of hundreds of suspected fraudulent voter registration applications in Lancaster County was evidence of cheating.

Lancaster election officials and the county district attorney announced last week they received a batch of suspected fraudulent voter registration applications, which had similar handwriting, incorrect information and other problems.

But that is hardly evidence of cheating – and in fact it shows the system worked to flag the applications, thanks to the checks in place to verify voters’ personal information and signatures before any ballots are cast, said Kathy Boockvar, a former Pennsylvania secretary of state.

“All these safeguards make sure that this doesn’t impact voting,” said Boockvar, a Democrat who is now president of Athena Strategies. “What it doesn’t do is it doesn’t actually make it any more likely that there’s going to be any more improper votes, thanks to all those guardrails in place.”

Because the state’s presidential election is so contested, it’s become a tinderbox for claims of fraud to spread like wildfire.

Last month, a conservative activist claimed voter fraud on X, in a post that quickly went viral, because 53 voters were registered at the same address, a Catholic church in Erie County. But it wasn’t voter fraud at all – there are 55 nuns of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie who live there.

Pennsylvania has also been the site of furious pre-election litigation, including over the rules about what mail-in ballots can be counted and how early voting is administered. Trump’s campaign and Republicans successfully sued to have Bucks County extend on-demand mail over complaints that voters had been turned away.

Elon Musk’s misinformation machine

Election experts say that misinformation surrounding a presidential election is nothing new. But what’s changed is the volume of viral claims that they’re trying desperately to keep up with.

Musk’s 2022 acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, has only added fuel to the fire, as he has pushed out numerous conspiracies to his 200 million followers on the site, as well as at town halls to support Trump’s candidacy.

Social media has been used in past elections to fuel conspiracies, including by foreign actors in 2016. But X and other social media companies have pivoted away from efforts to combat falsehoods spread on their sites.

Musk’s tactics have pushed election officials to go so far as to try – unsuccessfully – to personally convince him to stop spreading baseless claims that could mislead voters.

In Michigan this past week, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson tried to push back on a claim Musk shared about registered voters in Michigan, accusing him of “spreading dangerous disinformation.” Musk responded that Benson was “blatantly lying to the public.”

Musk was latching onto claims alleging there were more ballots cast in Michigan’s early voters than there were identified voters, which the secretary of state’s office said was due to a data “formatting error” that was corrected.

While Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, posted on X that her team had confirmed this issue was due to a glitch, that didn’t stop others in the conservative media ecosystem from continuing to amplify claims of fraud – refusing to back down from claims of a larger conspiracy.

CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, after spending 24 hours consuming pro-Trump media, reported the pro-Trump outlets are telling their viewers there’s no way the former president can lose, if the election is fair.

Election officials are trying to take a more proactive approach to false claims in their states and municipalities to knock them down quickly – like a false claim in Texas of a man claiming a voting machine had switched his vote.

But that’s often an uphill battle.

“The effect of all this election mis- and dis-information is when you survey people, they don’t believe anything they read online about elections, and that’s a problem when there are really great election officials trying to get information into the hands of voters,” said Ruth Greenwood, director of the election law clinic at Harvard Law School.

Manipulating early voting numbers

In 2020, Trump attacked early voting and mail-in voting, claiming they were used to cheat. His supporters, in response, largely voted on Election Day.

This time, Trump and the RNC have made a big push to use early and mail voting, even as Trump has continued to attack them.

As of five days before Election Day, more than 61 million Americans have already cast their ballots through either mail or early in-person voting. Both Democrats and Republicans have looked for positive signs for their side based on publicly available analysis of data that states report – and partisans have made sweeping predictions from the totals.

Voting and election modeling experts say that trying to game out election results based on early voting data is not statistically sound, because there are gaps in the data and the data only describes people who vote ahead of Election Day, not who they voted for or the intentions of tens of millions who will go to the polls on Tuesday.

The questionable claims about early voting data have stoked fears that the early voting numbers will be one thing that Trump and his allies use to question the election results should Harris prevail. There are also concerns that Trump is preparing to declare victory prematurely – just as he did early in the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before anyone had called the race.

Trump claimed he had won because he was ahead, ignoring the fact that the in-person votes, which tended to be more Republican-leaning, had been counted ahead of mail-in ballots, which leaned more Democratic.

While Republicans have embraced mail voting this year and there’s no pandemic pushing millions to vote that way, a similar phenomenon could still happen this election.

“If the trend from recent past elections continues, if Democrats are more likely to use vote-by-mail or absentee ballots and those ballots take longer to cast, then you’re going to see results shifting from Republican candidates being ahead to Democratic candidates pulling closer to them and potentially even surpassing them,” said Michael Morley, an election law professor at Florida State University College of Law. “Not because of fraud or something underhanded or nefarious going on, but because more ballots are being counted.”

Baseless claims of rampant non-citizen voting

Trump and his Republican allies have ramped up litigation as well as their rhetoric ahead of Election Day over the threat of noncitizens voting – and Trump in particular has claimed without evidence that Democrats are trying to allow non-citizens to vote.

“Our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote,” Trump said at the September presidential debate. “They can’t even speak English. They don’t even know what country they’re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote.”

Republicans have sought ahead of the election to purge voter rolls of suspected noncitizens. The Supreme Court sided with Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday, allowing the state to continue with a program that state officials say is aimed at removing suspected noncitizens from the voter rolls.

Voting rights groups have pointed to evidence that Virginia’s voter purge effort also caught up citizens who are eligible to vote.

The Justice Department also sued Alabama this fall over the state’s effort to remove more than 3,000 names from its voter rolls, arguing it violated federal law against such an action taking place too close to an election.

Experts say illegal voting by non-citizens is extremely rare, and when it does happen, it is usually caught quickly. A recent Georgia audit of the 8.2 million people on its rolls found just 20 registered noncitizens – only nine of whom had voted.

And Michigan earlier this week charged a Chinese citizen with voter fraud and perjury after he allegedly cast a ballot for the 2024 election, which experts say shows how rare instances of illicit voting are uncovered.

The focus on noncitizen voting has led to false allegations against Americans, too. In Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County, election officials issued a statement Wednesday debunking a viral video alleging non-citizens cut the line and were allowed to vote at an early voting site. In fact, the video showed a group of registered voters who needed the assistance of translators, according to a county spokesperson.

Republican litigation has also targeted overseas ballots cast by Americans living abroad and military service members. Trump falsely claimed that Democrats were trying to cheat with overseas ballots.

“The Democrats are talking about how they’re working so hard to get millions of votes from Americans living overseas. Actually, they are getting ready to CHEAT!” he wrote on Truth Social in September.

But courts in multiple jurisdictions have rejected Republican challenges to the procedures for vetting overseas ballots and to set aside ballots for additional checks of voters’ eligibility.

Fears of another attempt to challenge the result

Since the chaos in the aftermath of the 2020 election, officials have spent the past four years preparing both for increased threats of violence and efforts to block the certification of a legitimate election result.

Election officials have been inundated with threats of violence since the 2020 election. They’ve responded in 2024 by stepping up efforts to protect polling places and their workers on Election Day, including with bulletproof glass, wearable panic buttons and open lines of communication with local law enforcement.

Last month, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned that “election-related grievances” could motivate domestic extremists to engage in violence before and after the November election.

Ballots and drop boxes have been targeted already. Authorities are investigating fires at ballot boxes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, where hundreds of ballots were destroyed or damaged.

Once all the votes are cast, election officials and experts are preparing to try to stop a repeat of the 2020 election, where Trump sought out multiple avenues to try to overturn his election loss, culminating in his supporters rioting at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Election officials and experts say they hope to avoid a repeat of 2020, where if Trump loses the election, he and his allies make baseless claims that the other side cheated and the result is illegitimate.

There have been steps taken to blunt any attempt to of a 2020 repeat: Congress, for instance, updated the Electoral Count Act, the law that governs the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election, in an attempt to make it harder to block certification.

But Trump and his allies have been laying the groundwork to try to dispute the election should he lose.

The “Stop the Steal” movement has already reemerged before Election Day, and many of those activists have been telling their supporters that the only way Trump can lose in 2024 is through fraud.

In Georgia, conservatives sought to allow county election officials to refuse to certify the election results, though the effort was blocked by a state judge.

Another Trump ally, Maryland GOP Rep. Andy Harris, suggested last week that North Carolina’s GOP-controlled state legislature could award the state’s electoral votes to Trump before votes are even counted, arguing there was possible disenfranchisement of voters in western North Carolina due to complications from Hurricane Helene.

If Trump believes there is systemic fraud in the election, he will have the opportunity to prove it in the courts, just as he did after the 2020 election.

Ginsberg, the GOP election attorney, noted that the Republican National Committee’s plans for 200,000 poll watchers means the Trump campaign should be able to provide evidence to back up any alleged fraud claims.

“That means they ought to have hard evidence of anything that’s amiss,” he said. “And if they can’t produce hard evidence, then that should be a pretty clear indication that it once again is rhetorical smoke and not evidence.”

Donald Trump’s Florida residence and private club Mar-a-Lago is once again the Winter White House - the place to be seen for West Wing hopefuls as the US president-elect assembles a new administration behind its opulent doors. While President Joe Biden will remain in office until January, this part of Florida has become a rival centre of political power in America. Just two years after an FBI raid found classified documents about US nuclear weapons and spy satellites stored in a bathroom, an eclectic mix of insiders are swarming to Mar-a-Lago, which is patrolled by robot dogs and armed guards on boats. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, rumoured as a potential energy secretary, was there on election night. So was former US Defence Department chief of staff Kash Patel. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has been alongside Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago during family dinners and calls with world leaders. Musk has been photographed inside the private club with his son and on the runway of Palm Beach International Airport, as he shuttles back and forth to be by the president-elect’s side.

For those not blessed with an invitation to stay at Mar-a-Lago itself, the hotels and restaurants around nearby West Palm Beach are packed with office-seekers jostling for influence in the new administration and supporters celebrating Trump’s victory. Robert F Kennedy Jr, vaccine sceptic and scion of the one of the most famous US political dynasties, was by the swanky pool bar of The Ben hotel, where a fake ice rink and Christmas tree greet guests. Giant, golden Great Dane dog sculptures adorn the lobby and every floor outside the lifts. He is part of the transition team and the one-time presidential candidate is vying for a role with influence over health policy. Speaking even before the election, alongside the former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat-turned-Republican, he said: “There’s people of all different kinds of ideology and people that we’re going to have to go up against in that transition team and fight for our vision.”

Also spotted at The Ben was outspoken Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who recently blamed the Biden administration for causing flooding in Republican areas of North Carolina. She is believed to be jockeying for a cabinet position. At The Breakers, an opulent Italian Renaissance-style oceanfront hotel, the young valets were most star struck by the visit of Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who joined his friend Trump on stage on election night, but who says he has no personal political aspirations. The same cannot be said for others. One GOP insider that the BBC ran into in the corridors said the transition was “a free for all”, as different factions of the party battle for dominance. “Trump loves to see people scramble and suck up.” But the insider noted with a hint of worry that some “minimally acceptable people are starting to say they don’t want a role”. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, for one, has conveyed that he isn’t interested in working in the administration and would prefer a Senate leadership position.

Donald Trump is expected to focus less on elected officials to fill senior positions. His son, Don Jr, said during an interview on Fox News that he wants people who “don’t think they know better” than his father and that he’s prepared to block anyone he thinks would be a disaster. The president-elect has been vocal about doing things differently this time around, feeling his biggest mistake during his first presidency was hiring “bad people, or disloyal people”. Back in 2016, plans for the transition that had been prepared by former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in concert with the outgoing Obama administration were laid to waste. Once the Trump team won what was seen as an improbable victory, they decided on an unconventional approach and fired Christie. What ensued was an Apprentice-style parade of people to Trump Tower in New York that played out in front of the cameras. Back then, news crews packed into the lobby to capture everyone headed up the golden elevator to see Donald Trump on the 26th floor. While the world was still trying to understand what a Trump presidency would look like, those with influence in Wall Street, media, politics and entertainment all sought an audience, including Bill Gates, Al Gore and even Kanye West.

This time around, Trump seems to be prioritising loyalty, tallying up who has been with him since day one. And the world’s media are crammed onto hotel balconies and the parks and beaches surrounding Mar-a-Lago, where security is at fortress levels. The transition process is still unconventional by design, but so far it is far more behind the scenes than in 2016. Trump’s first appointment - Florida political consultant Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff - does offer one clue that a well-built Florida conservative political operation could be ready to replicate its success in the White House. Who is in the frame to join Trump's new top team? Slater Bayliss, co-founder of a Florida-based lobbying firm, Advocacy Partners, has worked both for and against Ms Wiles during election battles in the state and much prefers to be on her side. “I would say, borrowing a nickname from our friends across the pond, Susie is the Iron Lady of American electoral politics.” He says offers have been flooding in from talent across the state, which has served as a “stronghold of resistance for smart conservative thinkers who love our country and desire to play a role in making it more reflective of our electorate”. Republican political consultant Max Goodman says there is anticipation of a Florida wave crashing into Washington. He expects Trump’s team will be mining staffers in Susie Wiles’s team and in the state, whose congressional and Senate delegations came out early for Trump. “There is no hotter political farm system in the country than the state of Florida, when you have a president and the most prolific political consultant turned chief of staff calling Florida home,” he said.

Despite having the second largest Republican congressional delegation in the country, Mr Goodman says Florida has “notoriously been snubbed” when it comes to having a seat at the leadership table. He believes that could change with Ms Wiles leading the charge, and with key Floridians such as Rick Scott potentially in line as Senate Majority leader and Senator Marco Rubio in contention for a high-profile cabinet position. One person who has thrown his hand up to work in the transition is Joe Gruters, who is waiting to see how that shapes up. He was the 2016 co-chairman of Trump’s Florida campaign with Ms Wiles, then the chairman of the Republican state party, and is now a state senator. Mr Gruters describes himself as a “loyal foot soldier”, who was the only member of the Florida legislature to immediately endorse Trump’s 2024 bid and appear at Mar-a-Lago for his announcement. He is counting on Ms Wiles taking her “battle-tested” lieutenants up with her to Washington to fill out positions. “They know who the true believers are… and they probably have a clear idea of who they’re going to put in most of these positions,” Mr Gruters said.

When Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020, it seemed to be the death knell of his political career. His first term in office ended in chaos and condemnation - even from members of his own party. If he wins the election on Tuesday, it will be only the second time anyone has ever returned to the White House after previously losing a presidential re-election bid. “He gets knocked down and gets up twice as focused,” said Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser for the former president since Trump launched his 2016 campaign. “I don't think anybody should be surprised about this comeback.” Such an extraordinary reversal of fortune for the 78-year-old former president would also vault him back into the White House as a man who seems politically bulletproof, with a detailed plan of action and ranks of loyalists behind him.

A short-lived exile

Four years ago, Trump appeared a beaten man. His Democratic opponent, Biden, had defeated him by a comfortable electoral margin in the 2020 presidential contest. Courts had batted away his attempts to contest those results. His last-ditch rally in which he urged his supporters to march on the US Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the results culminated in the crowd launching a violent attack that sent those inside scrambling for safety. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were injured. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao were among a spate of Trump administration officials who quit in protest. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” DeVos wrote in her letter of resignation to the president. Even South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies, broke with the president. “All I can say is count me out,” he said on the floor of the Senate. “Enough is enough.” The movement away from Trump extended into the corporate world, as dozens of large companies – including American Express, Microsoft, Nike and Walgreens – announced they were suspending support for Republicans who had challenged the results of the 2020 election. On the day of Biden’s inauguration, Trump broke with 152 years of tradition by declining to attend the ceremony, instead flying back to his private club in Mar-a-Lago earlier that morning, accompanied by a handful of his closest aides and family. His mood was sullen, according to Meridith McGraw, author of Trump in Exile, an account of the former president’s time after leaving the White House. “He was angry, frustrated, unsure of how to spend his days and without a plan for his political future,” she said. The media coverage and political chatter that month reflected this uncertainty over his future. After a clear electoral defeat followed by the chaotic scenes at the Capitol, some were even more definitive, suggesting there was no way back for Trump. “And just like that, the bold, combustible and sometimes brilliant political career of Donald J. Trump comes to an end,” one opinion piece in The Hill read. The subheading of a January 2021 opinion piece in The New York Times declared: “The terrible experiment is over.” The headline was even more direct: “President Donald J. Trump: The End.”

But before Trump left for Florida on inauguration day, he hinted at what was to come. “We love you,” he said in remarks to supporters on a Maryland Air Force base tarmac. “We will be back in some form.” A week later, it became clear that Trump wouldn’t have to wait long to assert his continued political influence. The party came back to him. California Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, paid the former president a visit at Mar-a-Lago, posing for a photo next to a beaming Trump. In the immediate aftermath of the 6 January attack, McCarthy had said that Trump “bears responsibility” for the mob violence and recommended that Congress formally censure him for his conduct. Now he was pledging to work with the former president to win a congressional majority in the next year’s mid-term elections. Even as the Democrat-controlled US Senate was preparing to hold Trump’s impeachment trial, McCarthy’s Palm Beach pilgrimage illustrated that one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress still viewed the former president as a king-maker. “McCarthy’s visit really opened the door for Trump,” said McGraw. “It was a permission slip to Republicans who had criticised Trump to forgive him and move on.” Trump’s Senate trial would end in acquittal, as most Republicans – including some outspoken critics like minority leader Mitch McConnell – voted against a conviction that could have led to the former president being banned from future elective office.

McConnell had said that Trump’s conduct on 6 January was “a disgraceful dereliction of duty”, but he chose not to take the one step that could have conclusively ended the former president’s political career – perhaps out of fear of effectively ending his own. Republicans also worried that the former president might start a third party that would siphon off support from Republicans – concerns that Trump’s closest aides did little to dispel. “It’s clearly up to Republicans if this is something that becomes more serious,” Jason Miller, a long-time Trump communications aide, said in an interview with Fox News. The former president spent the next month mostly within the comfortable confines of his Mar-a-Lago club, venturing out only for a round of golf or a private dinner. By the end of February, as the furore around 6 January ebbed, he was ready to hold his first public event.

At the Conservative Political Action Conference – the right-wing confab typically held near Washington, DC but relocated to Orlando, Florida, due to Covid restrictions – the former president demonstrated that he still commanded the loyalty of the Republican base. Addressing thousands of cheering supporters in a sprawling hotel conference centre, Trump basked in the glow of their adoration. “I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together,” he said, “is far from over.” He also hinted, coyly, that he might beat the Democrats “for a third time” in 2024. An official straw poll of conference attendees only underlined what by then was obvious. Sixty-eight percent of respondents said Trump should run again. Fifty-five percent said they would vote for him in a contested primary – more then double the second-place candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. ""Trump and his team were pretty nervous about that speech,” McGraw said. “Psychologically it was a really important moment for Trump and his allies when he got such a positive reception.” After a brief hiatus, Trump reactivated his steady stream of fundraising emails to supporters and resumed holding his carnival-like outdoor rallies. “Do you miss me?” Trump asked at a June gathering in Ohio. The crowd responded with cheers. “They miss me,” he concluded.

Midterm highs - and lows

If 2021 hinted at Trump’s continuing influence within the Republican Party, the 2022 midterm elections confirmed it. By then, American military forces had haphazardly withdrawn from Afghanistan, leading to the fall of that nation’s US-backed government. Gas prices and inflation were approaching highs not seen in decades. US economic growth, which had been bouncing back from pandemic disruptions, sputtered. Biden’s approval ratings tumbled into negative territory. The political environment that had seemed so hostile to Trump at the beginning of 2021 was starting to shift. “Joe Biden failed to address the primary concerns of the voters,” said Lanza. “That gave Donald Trump an opening.” Mar-a-Lago became an obligatory stopping point for any conservative candidate seeking to become their party’s nominee. The former president’s endorsement was the most coveted prize – a key to unlocking fundraising dollars and grassroots conservative support.

Four of the six Republican House members who voted for Trump’s second impeachment and were running for re-election were defeated by Trump-backed candidates in party primaries. Meanwhile, Senate candidates like JD Vance in Ohio and Herschel Walker in Georgia pulled ahead in crowded primary fields with the help of Trump’s support. ”His endorsement all but guarantees you a primary win,” said Brian Seitchik, who worked as Arizona state director for Trump’s campaign in 2016 and as the western regional director in 2020. But if the first half of 2022 was unambiguous good news for the former president, November’s elections painted a much different picture. Of four prominent Trump-endorsed Senate candidates, only one – author turned politician Vance – defeated his Democratic opponent. While Republicans narrowly regained control of the House of Representatives, elevating Kevin McCarthy to the speakership, the party largely underperformed and Democrats retained control of the Senate. In Florida, Governor DeSantis, the distant second-place finisher in that 2021 presidential straw poll, won a surprising double-digit re-election victory, fuelling speculation that he might be the real frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Meanwhile, Trump fumed – blaming the Republican shortcomings on the party’s support of unpopular abortion restrictions and insufficient fealty to his own brand of conservative populism. Only a few weeks after the midterms, when pundits were still wondering if the former president’s political moment had passed, Trump formally launched his 2024 presidential campaign.

Trump’s path to the nomination

The start of his presidential bid seemed shockingly ill-timed. Just a few weeks after the Republican midterm misfire, it put the former president in the headlines when many were still wondering if he had lost his political instincts. His formal announcement, held within the cozy confines of Mar-a-Lago, made his campaign feel insular and ill-suited to the current political realities.

He would subsequently make news for all the wrong reasons - dining at Mar-a-Lago with Nick Fuentes, a prominent white nationalist, and posting on social media that rules in the US Constitution should be “terminated”, allowing him to be re-instated as president. “Thanksgiving through New Year’s was a pretty dark time on the Trump campaign,” McGraw said. Republicans were having their doubts. “He's announced that he's running for president, but are we sure that he's going to be able to pull this off?” she said, describing the mood at the time. “Does he have the discipline to actually do this?” Behind the scenes, however, Trump was assembling a campaign staff that – unlike 2016 and even 2020 – was headed by seasoned political operatives. Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles may not be household names, but the former was a bare-knuckled veteran of Republican politics with decades of experience and the latter had helped turn Florida into a conservative stronghold. The two worked with Trump to formulate a presidential primary strategy. While DeSantis was bogged down with official duties in Florida, Trump moved early to define the contours of the campaign, Lanza said. And while others deferred to the Florida governor, Trump hit him head-on, demeaning and diminishing him. “Everybody thought Ron DeSantis was at this powerful apex of politics that could not be torn down,” Lanza said. “Donald Trump tore the guy down.” The Trump side also received a boost from the unlikeliest of sources – prosecutors in New York, Georgia and the Justice Department in Washington, DC.

Starting with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for sensitive national security documents in August 2022 and culminating in a series of indictments in 2023, the former president’s criminal jeopardy became a central issue in the rapidly unfolding Republican presidential nomination fight. Trump’s mugshot, glaring in a photograph taken at an Atlanta jail in August, was soon plastered on campaign t-shirts and yard signs. For many on the left, justice was finally being served. But among the kind of conservative voters who choose their party’s nominee in early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, it became a moment to rally around their party’s embattled leader. Conservative pollster Sarah Longwell interviewed a panel of Iowa Republicans for PBS in June 2023, a week after the Justice Department indicted Trump on charges related to mishandling sensitive government documents. “I think he’s being set up,” said one. ""This is election interference like we have never seen before,” said another. The indictments, according to Lanza, created a divide within the Republican Party between those who saw the indictment as an abuse of power and those who didn’t. “Initially, Ron DeSantis took the ‘didn't’ approach,” he said. “And he became roadkill.” DeSantis had at first called the March 2023 New York indictment, which he noted was about Trump’s hush-money payments to an adult film star, a “manufactured circus” that wasn’t a “real issue”. By autumn 2023, Trump had opened a massive lead in most Republican primary polls – a margin he would never relinquish. He skipped the Republican primary debates, depriving them of political oxygen. He focused instead on cementing support among rank-and-file voters through his trademark rallies and grass-roots organising. Despite raising nearly $200 million in campaign funds, DeSantis was out of the race within days of finishing a distant second in the January 2024 Iowa Caucuses. After Trump easily beat former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, the Republican primary fight was effectively over. For the third straight presidential election, the party’s nomination was his.

Trials, tribulations and triumphs

The former president’s courtroom drama may have been a boon to his political fortunes, but it also came with very real legal jeopardy. In May 2024, a Manhattan jury convicted Trump on 34 felony counts involving hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

AFP

Every judicial setback, however, seemed to be followed by a bigger victory. His sentencing was delayed until after the election, the document indictments in Florida were discarded, and the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have sweeping immunity for official acts. Outside of court chambers, Trump’s campaign was rolling from his primary victory into the general election faceoff. A halting, confused performance by Biden in his late June debate with the former president left Democrats in a full-blown panic. Trump’s approval ratings and head-to-head polling numbers were ticking ever higher. And after his brush with an assassin’s bullet in Pennsylvania in mid-July, he arrived at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee a day later as a conquering hero to his supporters. “What we saw at the convention was how unified the Republican Party appeared, really for the first time in a long time,” said McGraw. “They were feeling incredibly confident.” Tesla chief Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, publicly endorsed the former president and began funding a massive organising operation in key battleground states. Republican pride – pride in Trump – was running high. At that moment, it seemed like Trump’s return to the pinnacles of American power from the depths of 6 January 2021 was all but complete. A campaign that had first vanquished DeSantis and his other Republican rivals was now set to deliver a knock-out punch to Biden and the Democrats. But three days after Trump formally accepted the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, Biden abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris. In a matter of a few weeks, Harris consolidated her party’s support, injected new enthusiasm into Democrats and even pulled ahead of the former president in some head-to head polls.

AFP

Trump’s efforts were not helped by a scattershot debate performance against Harris in September and an apparent difficulty reorienting his campaign to take on his new opponent, whose strengths – and weaknesses – are decidedly different from Biden’s. “Trump really wasn't tested until Harris got into the race,” said Seitchik. “Everything up to that point almost felt like an extended preseason for the campaign.” With election day looming, the season is almost over and the champion is still in doubt. The race is where it seemed to be headed at the beginning of the year – a photo finish where either candidate could end up on top. And for a campaign that had focused on Biden’s age and frailty, it is now Trump whose stamina and coherence are under the microscope. “Trump can have an incredibly professional, streamlined operation around him, but at the end of the day, he's still going to do what he wants and do things the way he wants,” said McGraw. That includes a continued public insistence that he did not lose the 2020 election, extended rhetorical diversions during rally speeches and last-minute cancellations of media appearances that some have attributed to “exhaustion”. Trump has been in the whirlwind of presidential politics for nine years now – and in the public spotlight for more than four decades. He has seemed indefatigable. But with another four years in the White House looming on the horizon, are the cracks beginning to show?

'Fundamental reorientation’ ahead?

While Trump’s victory is far from guaranteed, simply being this close to the prize once again is itself a remarkable achievement. And if his political comeback culminates in another presidential term, he will return to the White House having overcome obstacles – legal, political, many of his own creation – that few presidents have confronted. With control of the reins of power, and without the burden of having to face the judgement of voters again, Trump will be able to make those legal dangers disappear. And unlike his first term, he will be entering the White House with a team of advisers and potential administration staff who are fully loyal to him.

His intent to dramatically reorganise the federal bureaucracy could replace career civil service employees with political acolytes. And even if he doesn’t win full control of Congress, he could use existing presidential powers to impose new restrictions on immigration, enact his plans for mass deportation of undocumented residents and impose tariffs that are designed to protect US jobs but could significantly increase the cost of imported goods. Democrats warn that this would be a presidency without “guardrails” to limit what they say are Trump’s more dangerous proposals. Republicans, in a party that has been remade in Trump’s image, hope that he will be able to more effectively enact his agenda without the internal resistance he faced in his first term. “Donald Trump has converted the party from fiscal issues and social issues being the dominant force to a Trump populism,” Seitchik said. “This is all a fundamental reorientation of the Republican Party.” And if he wins next week, Trump could fundamentally reshape American government for generations to come.",How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq52zj466l7o
"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Trump picks Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be his Department of Health and Human Services secretary - CNN,"West Palm Beach, Florida CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump has picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be his next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a choice that would add to Trump’s list of provocative picks whose confirmation processes will test the loyalty of Senate Republicans.

Trump on Thursday announced the selection, confirming CNN’s earlier reporting, saying he was thrilled to share the pick.

“The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country,” Trump said in a post on X. “Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!”

Kennedy, who accepted the offer Thursday, has been one of the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists for years and has frequently spread false conspiracy theories about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He has been in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days following the election.

In a statement Thursday, Kennedy emphasized the importance of ridding the department of “corruption” and vowed to “provide Americans with transparency” so they can make individual health decisions.

“I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth,” Kennedy said.

If confirmed as the top public health official in the country, Kennedy would oversee the operations of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid. Though Trump has moved away from seeking to fully repeal Obamacare, it remains to be seen whether he and his health officials will release a plan to improve the law, as Trump promised on the campaign trail.

Kennedy would also be involved in any changes Trump and congressional Republicans attempt to make to Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income Americans. In Trump’s first term, the agency tried to institute work requirements, which was largely blocked in court, and lawmakers unsuccessfully sought to reduce the program’s funding. The program, which covers nearly 72.5 million Americans, is expected to be a target in Trump’s second term, especially as the GOP seeks savings to offset the tax relief they hope to implement.

Kennedy’s selection, first reported by Politico, is a notable one given that only days before the election, Trump’s transition co-chair Howard Lutnick told CNN that Kennedy was “not getting a job for HHS.”

“He would not be in charge of HHS?” he was asked on “The Source with Kaitlan Collins.”

“No,” Lutnick said, “of course not.”

That answer set off an internal uproar in Trump’s orbit, with Trump making clear to Kennedy that he would make the ultimate decision.

Kennedy had launched his own presidential bid last year – first as a Democratic challenger to President Joe Biden, then as an independent – focused largely on reversing “the chronic disease epidemic.” He proposed numerous policies aimed to overhaul food safety and environmental guidelines, promote holistic medicines and restructure public funding for vaccine research.

In the final days of Kennedy’s campaign, he met with Trump on multiple occasions, in which the two discussed the possibility of him endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in his administration. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump that same day.

In October, Trump teased Kennedy would oversee a public health portfolio while speaking at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, telling the audience he would let Kennedy “go wild on health,” “go wild on the food” and “go wild on medicines” if reelected.

On Thursday, shares of prominent vaccine makers plunged after Trump’s announcement that he’d selected Kennedy for the top health post.

Kennedy, since Election Day, has pledged to take major steps to reshape the nation’s public health guidelines. Last week, Kennedy said he would “immediately” begin studying vaccine safety and efficacy but promised to not “take vaccines away from anybody.” He also committed to formally recommending states and municipalities remove fluoride from public water.

Kennedy has also floated significant employee turnover at public health agencies. He said in an interview with MSNBC that he would cut workers in “the nutrition departments” at the US Food and Drug Administration. While speaking at a conference in Arizona on Saturday, Kennedy proposed replacing 600 officials at the National Institutes of Health with hand-picked staff.

In an interview with NPR News following the election, Kennedy laid out his areas of focus in Trump’s administration.

“President Trump has given me three instructions,” Kennedy said. “He wants the corruption and the conflicts out of the regulatory agencies. He wants to return the agencies to the gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based, science and medicine that they were once famous for. And he wants to end the chronic disease epidemic with measurable impacts on a diminishment of chronic disease within two years.”

"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Inside ‘the weave': How Donald Trump’s rhetoric has grown darker and windier - The Associated Press,"DULUTH, Ga. (AP) — No scene has dominated U.S. politics since 2015 quite like Donald Trump on stage, waxing on for an hour-plus in front of a chorus of red “Make America Great Again” hats.

The stream-of-consciousness routine, the interrupting one of his thoughts with the next, is not a polemic Cicero or Lincoln would recognize. The former president and Republican nominee calls his style of speech “the weave,” whipsawing from dystopian warnings to light-hearted storytelling to policy pronouncements.

“You make a speech, and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, you know, I mean, I weave stories into it,” Trump explained last week to popular podcaster Joe Rogan. “If you don’t — if you just read a teleprompter, nobody’s going to be very excited. You’ve got to weave it out. So you — but you always have to — as you say, you always have to get right back to work. Otherwise, it’s no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around. But it’s a big strain on your — you know, it’s a big — it’s a lot of work. It’s a lot of work.”

Over the closing weeks of his third presidential campaign, Trump’s presentation has grown as disjointed as ever and notably darker. But the crowds keep coming, cheering his nationalistic populism, laughing at the insults and chanting along, fists raised, with his benedictory pledges to make America strong, proud, healthy, wealthy and, of course, great again.

Trump’s speeches, while never the same, all employ consistent devices and themes. He wields humor, braggadocio, anecdotes, grievances and grand promises. There are non sequiturs, fantastical falsehoods and withering attacks on opponents. He sprinkles in vulgarities and superlatives. There are even the occasional stints read from the teleprompters he mocks when any other politician uses them — and then claims that he doesn’t use teleprompters or doesn’t need them.

What to know about Trump’s second term:

Staffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked recess appointments Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration.

Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, encourages voters to see him in person, suggesting doing so only affirms that he is erratic and unfit for office. Other critics compare his extended showmanship to authoritarian leaders. Or they argue “the weave” is simply cover for the cognitive decline of a 78-year-old who would be the oldest newly sworn U.S. president in history.

Here is a study of “the weave,” deployed on one night last week in suburban Atlanta.

Epic entrance and just enough details — even lies — make the case

Perhaps the most important moment is Trump’s entrance. His walkout music, a device that evokes his brief turn as a professional wrestling promoter, is Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless The U.S.A.” The former president stands on stage, silent and serious, as the crowd sings along.

At a recent Turning Point USA rally in Duluth, Georgia, pyrotechnics and large video screens flanking him at center stage added to the effect, as his on-screen likeness towered over the crowd. Trump looked out over thousands of cellphones recording the spectacle.

With the last notes of Greenwood’s opening hymn, Trump immediately relaxed and praised his audience as “thousands of proud, hardworking Americans and patriots, which is what you are.”

Then, in a more formal tone he seemed to shift to the prompters: “I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”

It’s the famous question Republican Ronald Reagan used to defeat Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Trump uses it as a way to tie Harris to President Joe Biden. But as soon as the crowd in Duluth yelled “no,” Trump moved to sweeping promises, hyperbole and superlatives that doubled as indictments of Biden and Harris.

“I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country,” he pledged, suggesting all migrants are criminals.

“We’re going to fix our nation fast,” he said. “America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure and disaster, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.”

Biden and Harris aren’t just bad, in Trump’s language. He called them “the worst president” and “the worst vice president” ever. Harris, he warned, would “destroy your family’s finances forever.” He blames Harris alone for “an open border,” taking liberties with immigration and crime statistics and suggesting, falsely, that the vice president singlehandedly controls U.S. immigration policy.

He slipped in that Harris “got no votes” — a reference to her becoming the Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out following party primaries. “Therefore,” Trump insisted, “she is a threat to democracy” — a Trumpian staple projecting onto his opponents their most aggressive attacks against him.

By the time he was done in Duluth, he had lampooned Harris as a “low-IQ individual” and “not a smart person.”

Thousands laughed at each broadside.

Transitions and accuracy are never necessary

Trump does not speak in a linear pattern as he builds to a crescendo. From his first Harris takedowns, he moved to expressions of compassion for Hurricane Helene victims and then jarringly to one of his favorite subjects: his public standing.

“Our hearts are with you and we are praying for you — the polls, despite everything. The polls,” he said. “Do you see what’s happening here? Here, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee? And Georgia. The polls. The polls are through the roof.”

Minutes later, during an audible crowd lull, he dropped in his signature “MAGA” slogan to elicit cheers.

“What a nice crowd this is!” he answers with a chuckle. “What a nice crowd.”

He bounced back to the prompter for numbers framing inflation’s effects on U.S. households. He asked, “should I sue” CBS and “60 Minutes” for, in his words, manipulating Harris interview answers that were “from the loony bin.”

“It’s election interference and fraud,” he said, projecting charges that are part of felony criminal cases against him.

Trump mocked Harris for saying she will raise taxes, but misrepresented her proposals as applying universally. (She targets corporations and the wealthiest individual filers.) Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, meanwhile, were “the largest tax cuts in history,” he said. (A charitable interpretation, at best, that ignores inflation.)

Specifics, though, are not the bottom line

Timothy and Amanda Browning reached different conclusions about Trump’s style after driving from their Georgia mountain town of Lula to attend their first Trump rally.

“I liked it, because it shows how authentic he is,” said Timothy Browning. “There are lulls — but you’ve got to stick with him because there’s always a zinger coming.”

Amanda Browning laughed as she recalled leaning over to her husband to whisper that Trump “sure could use a speechwriter.”

Still, the co-owners of an event space and catering business in Lula reaffirmed their loyalties to the former president.

Timothy sported a T-shirt that had a sexist insult of Harris coined by some conservatives after Biden named her his running mate in 2020. Browning said, though, that he does not consider himself, Trump or the former president’s supporters angry.

Instead, the Brownings keyed on Trump’s first-term economy and his pledges for an encore term. Talking about their business, they recounted specific price increases they’ve seen since pandemic-era inflation. They were not interested in pandemic supply chain interruptions or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiling world oil markets. Trump, they said, presided over a better situation for them than Biden and, by extension, Harris.

Timothy Browning summed up his takeaway in Trumpian terms.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Trump has vowed to shake some of democracy’s pillars - The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American presidential elections are a moment when the nation holds up a mirror to look at itself. They are a reflection of values and dreams, of grievances and scores to be settled.

The results say much about a country’s character, future and core beliefs. On Tuesday, America looked into that mirror and more voters saw former president Donald Trump, delivering him a far-reaching victory in the most contested states.

Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration. But his proposals are more complicated than that sounds and often lack specifics.

He won for many reasons. One of them was that a formidable number of Americans, from different angles, said the state of democracy was a prime concern.

The candidate they chose had campaigned through a lens of darkness, calling the country “garbage” and his opponent “stupid,” a “communist” and “the b-word.”

The mirror reflected not only a restive nation’s discontent but childless cat ladies, false stories of pets devoured by Haitian immigrant neighbors, a sustained emphasis on calling things “weird,” and a sudden bout of Democratic “joy” now crushed. The campaign will be remembered both for profound developments, like the two assassination attempts on Trump, and his curious chatter about golfer Arnold Palmer’s genitalia.

Even as Trump prevailed, most voters said they were very or somewhat concerned that electing Trump would bring the U.S. closer to being an authoritarian country, where a single leader has unchecked power, according to the AP VoteCast survey. Still, 1 in 10 of those voters backed him anyway. Nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters said they wanted complete upheaval in how the country is run.

In Trump’s telling, the economy was in shambles, even when almost every measure said otherwise, and the border was an open sore leeching murderous migrants, when the actual number of crossings had dropped precipitously. All this came wrapped in his signature language of catastrophism.

His win, only the second time in U.S. history that a candidate won the presidency in non-consecutive terms, demonstrated Trump’s keen ear for what stirs emotions, especially the sense of millions of voters of being left out — whether because someone else cheated or got special treatment or otherwise fell to the ravages of the enemy within.

That’s whom Americans decisively chose.

The centuries-old democracy delivered power to the presidential candidate who gave voters fair warning he might take core elements of that democracy apart.

After already having tried to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power when he lost to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mused that he would be justified if he decided to pursue “the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.”

This, in contrast to the oath of office he took, and will again, to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution” as best he can.

One rough and decidedly imperfect measure of whether Trump might mean what he says is how many times he says it. His direct threat to try to end or suspend the Constitution was largely a one-off.

But the 2024 campaign was thick with his vows, rally after rally, interview after interview, that if realized would upend democracy’s basic practices, protections and institutions as Americans have known them.

And now, he says after his win, “I will govern by a simple motto: promises made, promises kept.”

Through the campaign, to lusty cheers, Trump promised to use presidential power over the justice system to go after his personal political adversaries. He then raised the stakes further by threatening to enlist military force against such domestic foes — “the enemy from within.”

Doing so would shatter any semblance of Justice Department independence and turn soldiers against citizens in ways not seen in modern times.

He’s promised to track down and deport immigrants in massive numbers, raising the prospect of using military or military-style assets for that as well.

Spurred by his fury and denialism over his 2020 defeat, Trump’s supporters in some state governments have already engineered changes in how votes are cast, counted and affirmed, an effort centered on the false notion that the last election was rigged against him.

On Tuesday, Trump won an election in the time of a Democratic administration. The effort to revise election procedures will now be fought out by states in his time.

Yet another pillar of the system is also in his sights — the non-political civil service and its political masters, whom Trump together calls the deep state.

He means the generals who didn’t always heed him last time, but this time shall.

He means the Justice Department people who refused to indulge his desperate effort to cook up votes he didn’t get in 2020. He means the bureaucrats who dragged their heels on parts of his first-term agenda and whom Trump now wants purged.

Trump wants to make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government’s power to enforce statutes and rules by draining parts of the workforce and permit his administration to staff offices with more malleable employees than last time.

But if some or all of these tenets of modern democracy are to fall, it will be through the most democratic of means. Voters chose him — and by extension, this — not Democrat Kamala Harris, the vice president.

And by early measures, it was a clean election, just like 2020.

Eric Dezenhall is a scandal-management expert who has followed Trump’s business and political career and correctly predicted his wins in 2016 and now. He also foresaw that the criminal cases against Trump would help, not hurt, him.

Sussing out what Trump truly intends to do and what might be bluster is not always easy, he said. “There are certain things that he says because they cross his brain at a certain moment,” Dezenhall said. “I don’t put stock in that. I put stock in themes, and there is a theme of vengeance.”

So it remains to be seen whether America will get two special days Trump has promised.

Upon taking office again, he said, he’ll be a “dictator,” but only for a day. And he’s promised to let police stage “one really violent day” to crack down on crime with impunity, a remark his campaign said he didn’t really mean, just as his people said he wasn’t serious about subverting the U.S. Constitution.

The voters also gave Trump’s Republicans clear control of the Senate, and therefore majority say in whether to confirm the loyalists Trump will nominate for top jobs in government. Trump controls his party in ways he didn’t in his first term, when major figures in his administration repeatedly frustrated his most outlier ambitions.

“The fact that a once proud people chose, twice, to demean itself with a leader like Donald Trump will be one of history’s great cautionary tales,” said Cal Jillson, a constitutional and presidential scholar at Southern Methodist University whose new book, “Race, Ethnicity, and American Decline,” anticipated some of the existential issues of the election.

“Donald Trump’s actions will be as divisive, ill-considered, and mean-spirited in his second term as in his first,” he said. “He will undercut Ukraine, NATO, and the U.N. abroad and the rule of law, individual rights, and our senses of national cohesion and purpose at home.”

From the political left, any threats to democracy were not on the mind of independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont when he offered a blistering critique of the Democratic campaign.

“It should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” he said in a statement. “Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing?”

He concluded: “Probably not.”

For his part, Trump says he is intent on restoring democracy, not tearing it down.

There was nothing democratic, he and his allies assert, in seeing military leaders defy the elected commander in chief, whether the issue was troop deployments or his wish for a splashy military parade. Or in seeing Democratic presidents establish immigration policy and vast student loan relief though executive action, bypassing Congress.

But that case is built from the ground up on the lie of a stolen 2020 election, his machinations to stall the certification of that vote and his mob’s bloody attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He comes to office intending to pardon some of the people convicted for that riot and perhaps clear himself of criminal cases against him.

Guardrails remain. One is the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority loosened the leash on presidential behavior in its ruling expanding their immunity from prosecution. The court has not been fully tested on how far it will go to accommodate Trump’s actions and agenda. And which party will control the House is not yet known.

The Republican’s victory came from a public so put off by America’s trajectory that it welcomed his brash and disruptive approach.

Among voters under 30, just under half went for Trump, an improvement from his 2020 performance, according to the AP VoteCast survey of more than 120,000 voters. About three-quarters of young voters said the country was headed in the wrong direction, and roughly one-third said they wanted total upheaval in how the country is run.

By Trump’s words, at least, that’s what they’ll get.

"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump - The Associated Press,"Follow AP’s coverage of Donald Trump’s transition back to the White House.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fed up with high prices and unimpressed with an economy that by just about any measure is a healthy one, Americans demanded change when they voted for president.

They could get it.

President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to topple many of the Biden administration’s economic policies. Trump campaigned on promises to impose huge tariffs on foreign goods, slash taxes on individuals and businesses and deport millions of undocumented immigrants working in the United States.

With their votes, tens of millions of Americans expressed their confidence that Trump can restore the low prices and economic stability they recall from his first term — at least until the COVID-19 recession of 2020 paralyzed the economy and then a powerful recovery sent inflation soaring. Inflation has since plummeted and is nearly back to normal. Yet Americans are frustrated over still-high prices.

“His track record proved to be, on balance, positive, and people look back now and think: ‘Oh, OK. Let’s try that again,’ ” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former White House economic adviser, director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank.

Since Election Day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has skyrocketed more than 1,700 points, largely on expectations that tax cuts and a broad loosening of regulations will accelerate economic growth and swell corporate profits.

Maybe they will. Yet many economists warn that Trump’s plans are likely to worsen the inflation he’s vowed to eradicate, drive up the federal debt and eventually slow growth.

Trump policies could boost inflation

The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a leading think tank, has estimated that Trump’s policies would slash the U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — by between $1.5 trillion and $6.4 trillion through 2028. Peterson also estimated that Trump’s proposals would drive prices sharply higher within two years: Inflation, which would otherwise come in at 1.9% in 2026, would instead jump to between 6% and 9.3% if Trump’s policies were enacted in full.

Last month, 23 Nobel-winning economists signed a letter warning that a Trump administration “will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality.”

“Among the most important determinants of economic success,” they wrote, “are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.’’

Trump is inheriting an economy that, despite frustratingly high prices, looks fundamentally strong. Growth came in at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September. Unemployment is 4.1% — quite low by historic standards.

Among wealthy countries, only Spain will experience faster growth this year, according to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast. The United States is the economic “envy of the world,” the Economist magazine recently declared.

The Federal Reserve is so confident that U.S. inflation is slowing toward its 2% target that it cut its benchmark rate in September and again this week.

Americans are deeply unhappy with prices

Consumers, though, still bear the scars of the inflationary surge. Prices on average are still 19% higher than they were before inflation began to accelerate in 2021. Grocery bills and rent hikes are still causing hardships, especially for lower-income households. Though inflation-adjusted hourly wages have risen for more than two years, they’re still below where they were before President Joe Biden took office.

Voters took their frustration to the polls. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide, 3 in 10 voters said their family was “falling behind’’ financially, up from 2 in 10 in 2020. About 9 in 10 voters were at least somewhat worried about the cost of groceries, 8 in 10 about the cost of healthcare, housing or gasoline.

“I don’t think it’s either deep or complicated,’’ Holtz-Eakin said. “The real problem is the Biden-Harris team made people worse off, and they were very angry about it, and we saw the result.’’

The irony is that mainstream economists fear Trump’s remedies will make price levels worse, not better.

Tariffs are a tax on consumers

The centerpiece of Trump’s economic agenda is taxing imports. It’s an approach that he asserts will shrink America’s trade deficits and force other countries to grant concessions to the United States. In his first term, he increased tariffs on Chinese goods, and he’s now promised much more of the same: Trump wants to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60% and impose a “universal’’ tax of 10% or 20% on all other imports.

Trump insists that other countries pay tariffs. In fact, American companies pay them — and then typically pass along their higher costs to their customers via higher prices. Which is why taxing imports is normally inflationary. Worse, other countries usually retaliate with tariffs on American goods, thereby hurting U.S. exporters.

Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute have calculated that Trump’s proposed 60% tax on Chinese imports and his high-end 20% tariff on everything else would impose an after-tax loss on a typical American household of $2,600 annually.

The economic damage would likely spread globally. Researchers at Capital Economics have calculated that a 10% U.S. tariff would hurt Mexico hardest. Germany and China would also suffer. All of that depends, of course, on whether he actually does what he said during the campaign.

Deportations would rattle the US job market

Trump has threatened to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, potentially undermining one of the factors that allowed the United States to tame inflation without falling into recession.

The Congressional Budget Office reported that net immigration — arrivals minus departures — reached 3.3 million in 2023. Employers needed the new arrivals. After the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, companies struggled to hire enough workers, especially because so many native-born baby boomers were retiring.

Immigrants filled the gap. Over the past four years, 73% of those who entered the labor force were foreign born.

Economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project found that by raising the supply of workers, the influx of immigrants allowed the United States to generate jobs without overheating and accelerating inflation.

The Peterson Institute calculates that the deportation of all 8.3 million immigrants believed to be working illegally in the United States would slash U.S. GDP by $5.1 trillion and raise inflation by 9.1 percentage points by 2028

Big tax cuts could swell the federal deficit

Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals that were set to expire after 2025 and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He’s also called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, overtime pay and tips as well as further reducing the corporate income tax rate for U.S. manufacturers.

The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that Trump’s tax policies would i ncrease budget deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. Even if the tax cuts generated enough growth to recoup some of the lost tax revenue, Penn Wharton calculated, deficits would still increase by more than $4.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034.

The federal budget is already out of balance. An aging population has required increased spending on Social Security and Medicare. And past tax cuts have shrunk government revenue.

Holtz-Eakin said he worries that Trump has little appetite for taking the steps — cuts to Social Security and Medicare, tax increases or some combination — needed to bring the federal budget meaningfully closer to balance.

It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for. But it is also one that is expected to garner him influence over government policy - and the regulatory environment facing his enterprises.

Railing against regulation

Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible ""so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy"". At the time, he said creating the new Doge was ""the only path to extending life beyond Earth"". Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government. Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties. Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes. In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies. In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of ""regulatory overreach"". Musk ""stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,"" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: ""I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest."" Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government. ""There’s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,"" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London. ""At the same time, it’s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him. ""Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in."" ""Clearly he has got skin in the game and there’s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,"" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.

Reward for loyalty

For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates. But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021. He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (£79m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies. Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as ""transactional"", adding that the new role ""gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done"". As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past. But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon. ""Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there’s no-one who’s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,"" says Prof Gift. ""Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he’s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine."" In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office. ""That is actually quite extraordinary,"" says Prof Waddan. ""Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn’t get that kind of access.""

What is the Department of Government Efficiency?

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,What happens to Trump’s criminal and civil cases now that he’s been reelected - CNN,"CNN —

Donald Trump has been reelected to the White House as a convicted felon who is awaiting sentencing in his hush money case in New York and still working to stave off prosecution in other state and federal cases.

It’s an extraordinarily unique position for him to be in: Never before has a criminal defendant been elected to the nation’s highest office, just as an ex-president had never been criminally charged until last year.

Trump has said multiple times he plans to fire special counsel Jack Smith and end the federal cases against him for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and mishandling classified documents.

Smith is in active talks with Justice Department leadership about how to end the federal cases against Trump, a DOJ official familiar with the discussions told CNN.

“It clearly paid off to aggressively push to delay these cases as long as possible,” said Jessica Levinson, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School.

In the meantime, a judge in New York seems has delayed deadlines to sentence the former president later this month after holding off on handing down the punishment ahead of Election Day to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Here’s what to know about the four criminal cases:

New York sentencing

Trump was scheduled to appear in a New York courtroom on November 26 to receive a sentence for his conviction earlier this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during the 2016 campaign to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged a prior affair with the president-elect. (Trump denies the affair.)

Whether that sentencing happens at all remains an open question.

The Trump legal team is going to try to make sure the sentencing does not occur. In the past it has been focused on delaying proceedings in the case, but now it is going to try to get it canceled altogether, according to a source familiar with the strategy.

On November 12, Judge Juan Merchan said he was delaying deadlines for sentencing Trump now that he’s been reelected and asked both prosecutors and attorneys for Trump to file their views on the appropriate steps going forward by November 19.

Trump’s attorneys are expected to argues that as president-elect, he is entitled to the same constitutional protections as a sitting president and should be protected from any action by state prosecutors.

Merchan had previously faced a self-imposed November 12 deadline to decide whether to wipe away Trump’s conviction because of the Supreme Court’s ruling this summer granting a president some presidential immunity. If Merchan ultimately decides to wipe away the conviction, the charges would be dismissed, and Trump would not be sentenced.

But if the judge decides to keep the conviction intact, the former president’s lawyers are expected to ask Merchan to delay Trump’s sentencing so they can appeal. And if that’s not granted, his attorneys are planning to appeal the immunity decision to state appellate courts and potentially all the way to the US Supreme Court to ask the courts to delay Trump’s sentencing until all appeals are exhausted, which could take months.

Should Merchan move ahead with sentencing, Trump could be ordered to serve as much as four years of prison time, but the judge is not required to sentence the president-elect to prison, and he could impose a lesser sentence, such as probation, home confinement, community service or a fine.

Any sentence, of course, will be complicated by the fact that Trump is set to take office on January 20, 2025. Trump’s lawyers are likely to shape their appeals to raise constitutional issues challenging whether a state judge can sentence a president-elect, which could tie the case up in courts for years.

Since it is a state case, Trump does not have the power to pardon himself next year after he is sworn into office.

Federal cases in DC and Florida

Trump’s election victory is poised to have the greatest impact on the two federal criminal cases brought against him by Smith in Washington, DC, and Florida.

Since the cases were brought in 2023, Trump’s main legal strategy has been to delay the trials until past the election so that, if elected, he could fire Smith, leading to the end of the two cases. In late October, the former president said he would take such a step without hesitation.

“Oh, it’s so easy. It’s so easy,” Trump said when asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would “pardon yourself” or “fire Jack Smith” if reelected.

“I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump said.

The discussions between Smith and DOJ leadership are expected to last several days.

Justice Department officials are looking at options for how to wind down the two criminal cases while also complying with a 2020 memo from the department’s Office of Legal Counsel about indictments or prosecutions of sitting presidents.

More than a half-dozen people who are close to the special counsel’s office or other top Justice Department officials previously told CNN they believe Smith doesn’t want to close up shop before being ordered to do so or pushed out by Trump.

Under federal law, Smith must provide a confidential report on his office’s work to the attorney general before he leaves the post.

In the DC case, Smith charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020. The case was stalled for months as Trump pressed federal courts to grant him presidential immunity, and in July the Supreme Court issued a historic ruling that said he had some immunity from criminal prosecution.

The federal judge overseeing the trial has been deciding how much of Trump’s conduct at the center of the case is shielded by immunity after prosecutors last month laid out their arguments for why the ruling should have no impact on the case.

The charges brought by Smith against the president-elect in Florida accuse Trump of illegally taking classified documents from the White House and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. That case was thrown out in July by Judge Aileen Cannon, but prosecutors have appealed her ruling, which said that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appointment of Smith violated the Constitution.

Georgia RICO case

The immediate fate of Trump’s criminal case in Georgia largely hinges on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, is disqualified from prosecuting the matter after her prior romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor. But even if she is allowed to continue prosecuting Trump, the case would almost certainly be imperiled now that he has been elected.

The criminal charges against Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results are effectively on hold while the appeals court decides whether to disqualify Willis, a decision that is not expected until 2025.

If Willis is removed, sources told CNN they think it’s unlikely another prosecutor will want to take up the case and it will effectively go away.

Sources familiar with the case said it is unlikely that a state-level judge would allow proceedings to continue when Trump is president and, in that scenario, Trump’s attorneys would certainly move to have the case dismissed.

There is no clear answer as to whether a state-level prosecutor, like Willis, can prosecute a sitting president. Trump’s victory now forces Willis to confront that constitutional question in addition to the existing legal issues that have already cast uncertainly over the Georgia case’s future.

Civil suits

The former president is also defending himself in a litany of civil lawsuits, including ones concerning his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases, and a civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general where Trump was ordered to pay nearly $454 million in damages.

In September, state and federal appeals courts in New York heard arguments for two of Trump’s civil appeals.

Trump lost two defamation cases to Carroll in 2023 and 2024 in federal court after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing the onetime columnist and subsequently defaming her. Two juries awarded Carroll $5 million and $83 million.

A federal appeals court heard Trump’s appeal to dismiss the first Carroll verdict in September. The court has yet to issue a decision.

Later in the month, a state appeals court heard arguments in Trump’s efforts to dismiss the $454 million civil fraud judgment against him, in which a judge found he, his adult sons and his company fraudulently inflated the value of Trump’s assets to obtain better loan and insurance rates.

The five-judge appeals court appeared open to at least lowering the fine levied against Trump, though it also has yet to issue a decision. That ruling can be appealed to New York’s highest appellate court.

Trump is also still facing civil lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and others over his role in the January 6 Capitol attack.

It’s possible that all these cases continue to play out even as Trump serves his second term in the White House. In a 1997 Supreme Court ruling stemming from a civil lawsuit then-President Bill Clinton was involved in, the justices unanimously decided that sitting presidents could not invoke presidential immunity to avoid civil litigation while in office.

"Tue, 22 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,"As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator - The New York Times","Few top officials spent more time behind closed doors in the White House with President Donald J. Trump than John F. Kelly, the former Marine general who was his longest-serving chief of staff.

With Election Day looming, Mr. Kelly — deeply bothered by Mr. Trump’s recent comments about employing the military against his domestic opponents — agreed to three on-the-record, recorded discussions with a reporter for The New York Times about the former president, providing some of his most wide-ranging comments yet about Mr. Trump’s fitness and character.

Mr. Kelly was homeland security secretary under Mr. Trump before moving to the White House in July 2017. He worked to carry out Mr. Trump’s agenda for nearly a year and a half. It was a tumultuous period in which he drew internal criticism over his own performance and grew disenchanted and distressed by conduct on the part of the president that he considered at times to be inappropriate and reflecting no understanding of the Constitution.

In the interviews, Mr. Kelly expanded on his previously expressed concerns and stressed that voters, in his view, should consider fitness and character when selecting a president, even more than a candidate’s stances on the issues.","As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator  The New York Times",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html
"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Why Is Elon Musk Really Embracing Donald Trump? - The New Yorker,"On Wednesday, during a gathering at Mar-a-Lago attended by some of Donald Trump’s closest associates, a speaker demanded, “Where is the George Soros of the right?” In a scene that an attendee captured on video, Elon Musk, the fifty-three-year-old South African-born billionaire who reportedly spent about a hundred and thirty million dollars to aid Trump’s campaign and support other Republicans in competitive races, raised his arm. Amid loud cheers, the speaker declared, “God bless you, Elon. We are so, so grateful.”

Musk has claimed publicly that he has never asked Trump for any favors, and that Trump has not offered him any. Despite spreading misinformation on X, his social-media platform, and heavily financing the campaign of someone who plotted an autogolpe, he has also denied being a political extremist. After the Mar-a-Lago video surfaced, Musk wrote on X that he was the “ ‘George Soros’ of the middle.” In other words, he has portrayed himself as someone who entered the political arena to make the world a better place.

On Wall Street, there is a more self-serving explanation for Musk’s bear hug of Trump. “It’s a poker move for the ages,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has long been bullish on Tesla’s stock, told CNBC. If that’s true, the play has already paid off big time. Between Trump’s victory on November 5th and the close of trading on Friday, Tesla’s stock price went from $251.50 to $320.72. According to Tesla’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk owns about 715 million shares, so based on that figure the value of his stake has risen by almost fifty billion dollars. This vast sum dwarfs the millions he spent on Trump’s behalf, and even the forty-four billion dollars that he and a group of investors paid for Twitter in 2022, an acquisition that greatly increased his ability to influence the political process. Soros, during his career as a Wall Street speculator, had some big scores, but none of them were anywhere near as monumental as Musk’s post-election gains.

The run-up in Tesla’s stock reflects investors’ conviction that the policies of a second Trump Administration will be favorable to the carmaker. But the presence of Trump in the White House could also have important implications for Musk’s other companies, many of which are subject to oversight by federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, or which have big contracts with government departments.

For example, SpaceX, Musk’s innovative rocket company, has received nearly twenty billion dollars in federal contracts since 2008. It is now a major provider of launches to the International Space Station, and, in 2022, it surpassed Boeing as NASA’s second most utilized contractor. SpaceX already stands to receive billions more in the coming years, but a new NASA mission to Mars, say, could open the federal spigot even wider. Trump hasn’t said much about that idea publicly, but Musk posted, a couple of weeks ago, “Vote for @realDonaldTrump if you want humanity to make it to Mars!”

Trump’s determination to build up the U.S. Space Force that he created in 2019 could send more federal dollars in the direction of SpaceX. In October, the Space Force awarded a $733.6 million contract to Musk’s company for space launches. If Trump expands its budget, more contracts could well result. Elsewhere, Musk’s satellite company, Starlink, which came to public attention for its role in providing Internet service in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, may also stand to benefit from the election. During the first Trump Administration, the Federal Communications Commission provisionally awarded Starlink nearly nine hundred million dollars under a program to deliver broadband to rural areas, but last December the agency cancelled the funding on the grounds that the company had failed to meet the program’s requirements. Now some Republicans want to restore it.

Tesla is the big kahuna, however. On Thursday, its stock sank on reports that the Trump transition team is planning to eliminate the seventy-five-hundred-dollar federal tax credit for E.V. buyers that the Biden Administration expanded as part of its green-industrial policy. If this cancellation stalls further adoption of E.V.s, it would seem likely to hurt Tesla—but the outlook isn’t so clear. Since Joe Biden came to office, legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors have invested heavily in new E.V.s and E.V. plants, but so far they haven’t made a huge dent in Tesla’s market share, which is still hovering at around fifty per cent. Musk now seems to be betting that eliminating the credits would prompt other automakers to cut back their expansion plans for the E.V. market, or even abandon them entirely, which would reinforce Tesla’s dominant position. “I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly,” he said during a July earnings call. “But, long term, probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess.” On Thursday, Musk responded to the news that Trump was, indeed, moving toward eliminating the tax credits. “In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas,” he wrote on X.

Looking ahead, Musk has made clear that he believes Tesla’s future hinges on its autonomous driving system, known as Autopilot, which it has been investing heavily in for years and pressing regulators to approve for a rollout. Last year, Musk said that Tesla’s high stock-market valuation was “primarily on the basis of autonomy.” But his plan to turn Tesla into a producer of driverless vehicles has run into obstacles. The day-to-day regulation of motor vehicles takes place at the state level, and Tesla, which was long based in California, has been making slow progress with lawmakers in Sacramento. Moreover, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (N.H.T.S.A.) has found that Tesla’s driver-assisted version of Autopilot contributed to hundreds of crashes and more than a dozen fatalities. The agency is now evaluating the effectiveness of a software update that Tesla issued last December.

Despite the ongoing federal investigation, during a Tesla earnings call in October, Musk called for a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,” which would dispense with lengthy state-by-state applications. He didn’t explain why such a system would work better for Tesla, but, given that Trump’s reëlection was in the offing, perhaps no explanation was really needed. “There will be a knock on the door for N.H.T.S.A., and it’s Musk,” Ives, the Tesla-stock bull, said. Ives predicted that switching to a federal system of regulation could speed up approval of driverless cars by at least two or three years. “This is what the stock is starting to reflect,” he added.

In another apparent paradox, Trump’s proposals to impose tariffs of up to sixty per cent on imports from China, where Tesla has its biggest factory, could also end up helping the carmaker. The new tariffs would reinforce the barriers that keep out cheap Chinese E.V.s, which I wrote about earlier this year, and which potentially represent an existential threat to all American carmakers, Tesla included. On the other hand, the tariffs could raise Tesla’s own costs. Although Tesla doesn’t import the vehicles it makes in China to the United States, it does import some of the components of its American-made cars, and their prices could rise sharply—unless, of course, the second Trump Administration granted it the same sort of carve-out from the new tariffs that the first Trump Administration granted to Apple after a personal appeal by its C.E.O., Tim Cook. Is Trump likely to grant Musk such an invaluable favor? “We have to protect our geniuses.

There’s a Reason They Keep Winning. - The New York Times,"In December 2019, I traveled to Hong Kong, where a heavy unease hung in the air. For months, young people had taken to the streets to protest the encroachment of the Chinese Communist Party on what was supposed to be a self-governing, democratic system. On walls they had scrawled: “Save Hong Kong! If we burn you burn with us!” All the protesters I spoke to knew their movement would fail; it was a last assertion of democratic identity before it was extinguished by a new order that saw democracy as the enemy within.

I met with a government official preparing to resign and told him I was writing a book about the rise of authoritarian nationalism. “The nationalism in the U.S. and Europe is somewhat different,” he told me. “Yours started with the financial crisis in 2008. That’s when liberalism started to lose its appeal, when people saw this wasn’t working. The narrative of liberalism and democracy collapsed. This spilled over into China, too. This is when China started to think — should we really follow a Western model?” We were sitting in a hotel lounge, the invisible forces he described surrounding us: capitalism, but not democracy; cultural elites cloistered away from the working class. “The nationalist movements in East and West were both a response to the collapse of the Western model,” he added.

Everything I’d experienced told me he was right. Eight years serving in the Obama White House after the financial crisis felt like swimming upstream, against the currents of global politics. A radicalized Republican Party rejected liberal democracy at home, mirroring far-right leaders like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary who spoke about installing “illiberal democracy” (a polite term for “blood and soil” nationalism) across Europe. In Russia, Vladimir Putin set out to undermine — if not dismantle — the liberal order helmed by the United States. In China, Xi Jinping began to shift Beijing’s strategy from rising within that order to building a separate one, drained of democratic values. Barack Obama’s political skills and cultural appeal allowed him to navigate those currents, but they didn’t always transfer to other Democrats.

Donald Trump’s first victory challenged my liberal assumptions about the inevitability of a certain kind of progress: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” For eight years outside of government, I have talked to opposition figures around the world and heard versions of the same story everywhere.

"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,First on CNN: Trump picks Kristi Noem to serve as his Homeland Security secretary - CNN,"CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump has selected South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as his next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, according to two people familiar with the selection.

“Kristi has been very strong on Border Security,” Trump said in a statement officially announcing the pick later Tuesday.

“She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries,” he added.

Noem has been tapped to take over the agency as two key immigration hardliners — Stephen Miller and Tom Homan — are slated to serve in senior roles, signaling Trump is serious about his promise to crack down on his immigration pledges. With his selection of Noem, Trump is ensuring a loyalist will head an agency he prioritizes and that is key to his domestic agenda.

The department saw an immense amount of turmoil the last time Trump was in office. Then, DHS had five different leaders, only two of whom were Senate-confirmed. The agency has a $60 billion budget and hundreds of thousands of employees.

Noem, who previously was a South Dakota representative, will now be tasked with overseeing a sprawling agency that oversees everything from US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the US Secret Service.

Although Noem does not represent a border state, she has a long history of taking hardline positions on immigration. As a candidate for Congress in 2010, she supported an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Senate Republicans to thwart an Obama administration lawsuit challenging an Arizona immigration law. She also has called for punishment of Democratic-led “sanctuary cities” that protected undocumented immigrants by not cooperating with federal agencies during Trump’s first term.

As governor, Noem sparred with indigenous tribes in her state, suggesting that tribal leaders were focusing more on benefiting from drug cartels than their children, comments that led to her being banned from some tribal lands. As DHS secretary, Noem would be in charge of a department that is involved in tribal issues.

Longtime Trump loyalist

Since taking office in 2019, Noem has established herself politically as a governor in Trump’s style and has long sought to curry favor with the president-elect. She was a vociferous opponent of Covid-19 safety measures such as enforced masking and business and church closures, and once said at a National Rifle Association event that her 2-year-old grandchild has multiple guns. In 2020, The New York Times reported that Noem once presented Trump with a four-foot replica of Mount Rushmore that added his face to the pantheon of American presidents and she was one of the earliest governors to endorse him ahead of his 2024 run for president.

Trump, in turn, has called Noem a “terrific person,” and she was once considered a top potential running mate as he geared up for his 2024 run. But she eventually fell off the shortlist, and then suffered an embarrassing political episode following the publication of her book: “No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.” In it, she revealed that she once killed her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, Cricket, when she was not displaying the signs of an ideal hunting dog.

The governor wrote that the dog was “untrainable,” according to excerpts first reported by The Guardian. Noem later argued that those anecdotes were meant to show how capable she is of doing some of the more gruesome jobs in life when necessary.

Still, Noem has remained a staunch ally of Trump’s. In the closing weeks of the 2024 campaign, The Atlantic reported that Noem participated in a strategy briefing with Trump, questioning findings by campaign officials about the state of the race. And she moderated a memorable town hall in October when Trump swayed to music for more than 30 minutes.

Four years ago, Donald Trump was a man facing defeat.

A grueling campaign against former Vice President Joe Biden for a second term in the White House, taking place amid the Covid-19 pandemic, was dragging into the late hours of Election Day. As the country and the world waited anxiously to see whether Trump would be gracious as the votes were counted — or at least careful in his rhetoric at a precarious moment for the country — the president took the stage at the White House and proved that he would not go quietly.

“We were getting ready to win this election,” he said.

“Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump falsely added.

Those six words would set the standard for the years of deception and lies that would follow, ultimately resulting in a violent insurrection at the Capitol and culminating with Trump facing criminal charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the democratic will of the American people.

Trump’s defeat, and the ensuing extreme and allegedly unlawful actions done in his name by his supporters and his close allies, left the nation more divided than it had been since the Civil War and would temporarily render him a pariah in mainstream Republican politics after Biden took office.

But his time as an outcast would not last long.

Four years later, Trump has again reclaimed control of the White House — and promises to enact an agenda that he says will not be hamstrung by the aides, Cabinet members and generals who surrounded him during his first term and kept his impulses in check.

Despite a felony conviction, two attempts on his life and rhetoric that would have surely sunk any other political campaign, he has completed the ultimate comeback.

In the years since that 2020 defeat, Trump has experienced personal tragedy, including the death of Ivana Trump, who was his first wife and the mother of his three oldest children.

He relocated from New York, where he was born and where he and his father made their last name famous as they built a real-estate empire, to his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. That home became the nucleus of Republican politics and a destination for GOP power players to make a pilgrimage to kiss Trump’s ring as it became clearer that he would remain the leader of the party, even if he was no longer the leader of the country.

It’s where, in August 2022, the FBI recovered hundreds of classified documents in a stunning raid. Trump’s alleged mishandling of those materials would form the basis of one of four criminal cases brought against him during his period out of the White House.

More than 320 classified documents had been recovered from the former president's resort, the Justice Department said. (Department of Justice)

Months later, Trump used the estate to announce his intention to seek the White House in 2024 — opening his third presidential campaign.

But as he set his sight on the next race, a series of investigations into his first term were reaching their head.

In late 2022, the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol issued a damning, 800-plus page final report that laid the blame for much of the violence that day squarely at Trump’s feet.

“None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” it said.

As a cascade of investigations swirled around Trump’s time in office and its chaotic, bloody end, the first criminal case brought against the former president centered on his first successful run for office in 2016.

A grand jury in New York returned an indictment against Trump charging him with falsifying documents to obfuscate payments to an adult-film star who alleged an affair with Trump years earlier.

It was the first time a former president had faced criminal charges. It would not be the last. He was charged in federal court for charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents just months later.

But as the criminal cases against Trump snowballed, he still sought to litigate the results of the election he lost in 2020.

“That was a rigged election,” the former president said during a CNN town hall, “and it’s a shame that we had to go through it.”

Though several Republicans mounted primary campaigns against Trump, most of them were wary of saying or doing anything that might anger him.

During an August 2023 debate, eight Republican primary candidates were asked whether they would support Trump if he were the nominee and convicted in a court of law.

The group included Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, who defied the wishes of his boss and certified Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.

Six of the candidates, including Pence, raised their hands to signal they would still support Trump. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wagged his finger. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was the only one who indicated he did not plan to support Trump if he were to be convicted.

Trump was not on the stage, but the power he exerted over those who were was clear.

The challenges to Trump’s grasp on the Republican Party were unsuccessful. His two strongest opponents, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, would both drop out and endorse him.

The Republican Party was his for the taking. But, the legal hits kept coming.

The day after that debate, Trump stood for a mug shot in Fulton County, Georgia, where a third criminal case had been brought for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to change the outcome of the 2020 election.

In a civil case, another New York jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting the writer E. Jean Carroll.

And in May 2024, the New York jury on his hush-money case convicted him on several charges of falsifying business records. It was another first for the former president — the first time a former commander in chief had been convicted of a crime.

Trump was a felon. His path to the White House remained open.

The shakeups in the race, though, were not over.

On June 27, 2024, Trump participated in the first — and ultimately, only — debate with Biden, who had defeated Trump’s bid for the White House years earlier and cast his opponent as an existential threat to democracy.

But Trump’s performance — which was strong, albeit largely fact-free — was mostly forgotten thanks to the 81-year-old incumbent’s unsteady and feeble showing. It set off a cacophony of second-guessing among Democrats that would eventually lead to the president dropping from the race and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place against Trump.

And just weeks after that debate, Trump barely survived an attempt against his life.

A sniper’s bullet grazed the former president’s ear as he was giving a speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Trump survived, but one of his supporters, seated behind the former president, did not. The gunman was killed by police after firing multiple shots.

Politicians across the aisle raced to denounce political violence, while Trump’s supporters were energized to coalesce around their near martyr.

Trump’s leadership of the Republican Party was cemented just days later, as the party nominated his candidacy for president for the third time in a row.

The MAGA movement has flipped from being a branch of the Republican Party to fully encompassing it, and Trump has retaken his position at the party’s kingmaker.

With his election, Trump once again has reached the pinnacle of personal and political power — and promises to push that power past its limits as he embarks on another term.",Donald Trump pulled off the ultimate comeback.

Travelling with the President

I'm traveling with President Biden today - and just a few moments ago we left the historic Grubb-Worth Mansion in the town of Claymont, not far from where Biden grew up.

In brief and at times emotional remarks to a crowd of locals and veterans - including at least one elderly veteran of World War Two, dressed in uniform - Biden recalled the memory of his now deceased son Beau, a veteran of the US Army who deployed to Iraq.

The event was to dedicate a plaque to Beau, a move which Biden said left him ""deeply humbled"".

An emotional Biden said he still thinks about Beau ""every day"", but particularly on Veterans Day.

""He was so damn proud he joined the military,"" the president said. ""Our entire family felt that pride.""

“Like so many of you, you remember how hard it was, the empty seat at the dinner table,"" he added.

While today's speeches have avoided politics, Biden did say that the government has ""an obligation"" to protect those who fight for the US - the only country, he said, that is based off ""an idea"".

“We've never walked away from [that duty], even though there's been temptations to walk away.”

After his remarks, Biden went to a local cemetery to see Beau's grave. Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.",US election live updates: Donald Trump administration takes shape with key appointments under way  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2e7jdjdmplt
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Donald Trump,Donald Trump elected 47th US president - Al Jazeera English,"The Republican candidate has won at least 277 Electoral College votes, per The Associated Press.

Donald Trump has been elected to return to the White House as the 47th United States president.

The vote was called for the Republican candidate by The Associated Press news agency early on Wednesday. His victory has been met by international congratulations but is likely to add further uncertainty to a turbulent geopolitical situation.

Results showed Trump beating Vice President Kamala Harris in a race far less tight than expected as he triumphed in key battleground states.

Victory in Wisconsin after earlier triumphs in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania saw the former president clear the threshold of the 270 Electoral College votes required to clinch the White House in Tuesday’s election.

Trump’s victory in those swing states currently sees him with 277 electoral votes against 224 for Harris. Polls had predicted a much tighter race, but it appears that anger fuelled the Republican’s remarkable comeback from defeat in 2020 and widespread condemnation of his refusal to accept the result.

That refusal sparked a violent insurrection at the US Capitol, and Trump was also convicted of felony charges and survived two assassination attempts.

However, his campaign, which has seen him demonise his political opponents, immigrants and many minorities, tapped into the frustrations of many voters in a bitterly polarised nation.

Speaking to his supporters as he declared victory, Trump claimed he had won “an unprecedented and powerful mandate”.

Anger and resentment

Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at University College Dublin, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s victory stemmed from frustrations that have been bubbling within the US public for years.

“There is anger and resentment in the US, which has been there for quite some time. It’s been a trauma since 9/11. It’s been there with the financial crash in 2008-2009. It was there in 2016 when Trump exploited it, and he exploited it again,” Lucas said, adding that Trump was able to do that because the “political system is damaged”.

Concern over the economy, and inflation in particular, under President Joe Biden was a major focus of the campaign.

That also encouraged opposition to the support Washington is giving to Ukraine in its war against Russia. Meanwhile, the failure to rein in Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon has angered Muslim and liberal voters.

Those complex geopolitical issues will test Trump, who is known for his simplistic claims of being capable of quickly solving such issues.

He has promised to end the war in Ukraine in a day, an idea that has Kyiv wary that it could face pressure to strike a deal to hand over territory to Russia. NATO allies, meanwhile, fear Trump will weaken the alliance’s mutual defence guarantees.

Trump is also a strong supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has boasted he will end the war with Hamas in Gaza in hours.

“Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!” Netanyahu said in a statement after Trump declared victory.

The enthusiasm in Israel also stems from the incoming president’s hawkish approach to Iran, which he is likely to reassert.

China is also braced for a more confrontational relationship with the US under Trump, who is expected to revive staunchly nationalistic trade policies, putting both allies and rivals on edge.

‘Much more dangerous era’

However, at home, supporters will look to Trump to put the focus on the welfare of US citizens while following through on promises to enact an agenda that would transform nearly every aspect of American government.

That will include plans to launch the largest deportation effort in the nation’s history and use the Department of Justice to punish his enemies.

The result is that “we are going into a much more dangerous era for Americans and for the world because this will not be a coherent US policy for America but one pursued for Trump,” Lucas said.",Donald Trump elected 47th US president  Al Jazeera English,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/donald-trump-claims-win-kamala-harris

CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to completely remake the US government and wield new power as president.

The ambitious promises, if enacted, would transform society. Some of his most-repeated promises on the campaign trail include:

Now Americans will find out what was hyperbole and what was real – what is achievable and what he will be able to push through by himself, with help from Congress and without interference by the courts.

His pledge to end Russia’s war on Ukraine “in 24 hours,” for example, seems overwrought, to say the least.

His pledge for a mass deportation effort, on the other hand, is very serious. It seems to be backed up by some clear planning but there’s a lack of public details.

Is there a master plan?

During the campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, the controversial and detailed blueprint for a newly reimagined federal government published by conservatives at the Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump term.

While Trump may not want to associate with that plan, it was formulated by his allies – at least 140 people associated with Project 2025 worked in Trump’s administration, according to a review by CNN’s Steve Contorno. Certainly there is some overlap between much of what the 900-page Project 2025 proposes and what Trump has said he will do in a series of very simple “Agenda47” videos on his website laying out his plans for a second term.

In one Agenda47 video, for instance, Trump promises to have an executive order prepared to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. The 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship, so expect court fights if this happens.

One of the policy maestros of Protect 2025, Russell Vought – who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term – was captured on hidden camera by undercover journalists over the summer talking about an aggressive agenda he was writing to get Trump’s new administration off to an active start in its first 180 days.

On mass deportations

Trump’s most aggressive promise is the rounding up and deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. Expect Trump to come into office with a series of executive orders already written to reinstate border policies unwound by the Biden administration.

Such is the yo-yoing of US immigration policy given that Congress has been unable to pass meaningful reform for decades. What’s not clear is how exactly Trump will go about closing the US border and whether it will include the US military, the National Guard or local law enforcement agencies.

Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News to expect deportations to begin the moment Trump is again president on January 20, 2025.

“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.

But it’s still not clear exactly how deportations will work. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday that he expects every undocumented immigrant will continue to get a hearing before he or she is deported, something that will require the hiring of a large number of additional government workers if deportations are amplified to a massive scale. The current process is lengthy.

“I agree; it’s going to be a very, very big task,” Gimenez said. “And my hope is, and I expect, that we’ll just simply follow the law.”

CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez reported there have already been discussions among Trump allies and some in the private sector to detain and deport migrants at a large scale – though any operation would come with a big price tag.

She noted that Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term, has said a deportation effort would start with anyone accused of a crime. It’s not clear what would happen to so-called Dreamers, people brought to the US as children who have lived most of their lives here. Some of them are protected by an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Trump tried unsuccessfully to end during his first term.

Plans to ‘aggressively’ fire government workers and move agencies out of DC

At the end of his first term, Trump planned to reclassify a large portion of the federal civilian workforce to make it easier to fire federal workers. Commonly referred to as “Schedule F,” Trump’s plan was to undo long-standing protections for nonpartisan civil servants.

The Biden administration has put some roadblocks in place to ward against such reclassification, but Trump promises in an Agenda47 video to immediately begin working to reinstate it so that he can “remove rogue bureaucrats.” He says he will also “clean out all of the corrupt actors” in the national security and intelligence apparatus and “immediately” move federal agencies out of the nation’s capital.

John McEntee, who was director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office during Trump’s first administration, worked on Project 2025, building a list of Trump loyalists suitable for administration roles. He remains close to Trump, according to CNN’s report on Trump’s transition.

McEntee said recently he wasn’t involved with the policy recommendations in Project 2025, even though he said, “I agree with probably most of it.” Instead, he’s interested in “staffing the president with good people … I think he deserves that.”

What about Trump’s Cabinet?

Trump likes to associate himself and his programs with boldface names. Musk will have a role in government efficiency but probably not a Cabinet position. Kennedy says he wants to give individuals more agency to reject vaccines for their children, but perhaps that does not mean he will have a Cabinet position. Does Trump’s promise at a rally in Georgia to put Walker in charge of a missile defense program mean an official government job for the failed Senate candidate?

There are 26 people in President Joe Biden’s Cabinet. Some, like CIA director or US ambassador to the United Nations, can be added or subtracted depending on the administration. Only two of the 26 potential positions in a Trump Cabinet are in place. Look for Trump to continue naming top officials in the coming days.

In addition to Vice President-elect JD Vance, Trump’s first key personnel news came Thursday night when he announced Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, would become his chief of staff. She’ll be the first woman to hold the position. Trump went through four such top aides during his previous administration. The longest-serving of those, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, had warned against Trump’s election.

Trump can simply hire a chief of staff, but most Cabinet positions, like secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, will require Senate confirmation. Trump will have a Republican majority in the Senate, which should ease the confirmation of key positions, but each of the ultimate Cabinet appointees will have a confirmation hearing before they get a vote.

Frustrated by the difficulty of getting Cabinet officials confirmed during his first administration, Trump frequently appointed people as “acting” secretaries, although those appointments can only be made on a temporary basis.

Trump’s oldest son, Donald Jr., said on Fox News that Trump will prize loyalty and look for “people who don’t think that they know better than the duly elected president of the United States.”

Taking power away from Congress

Trump won’t have the 60 votes he’ll need to shoot sweeping legislation quickly through Congress without bipartisan support in the Senate. It’s not yet clear if Republicans will hold control of the House, but any majority will be slim.

One of his big plans to challenge current governing norms that’s gotten less attention is his pledge to seize some power over government spending from Congress. In one Agenda47 video, Trump says he would try to reassert the principle of “impoundment,” by which a president can reject spending instructions from Congress and use taxpayer money in other ways.

Congress reined in presidents with a law after the Nixon administration, but Trump says he will challenge it and take more power for the president.",Trump’s master plan for a radical reformation of the US government  CNN,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/politics/donald-trump-government-what-matters/index.html

BB: Welcome back to the final episode in our eight-part series that I am calling On My Heart and Mind. We started the series with my conversation with Valerie Kaur on the power of revolutionary love, the importance of a multicultural democracy, what it means to be a sage warrior. I’ve talked to the stunning Dr. Sarah Lewis on her book, The Unseen Truth, Roxane Gay on her essay on Black gun ownership. I talked to Mary Claire Haver, my friend, OB-GYN, on menopause and the epic failure of the American medical field to focus research and learning on women in their 40s and 50s and beyond. Had a great conversation, hard conversation, with my sisters on grief and love and unexpected joy. My mom died on Christmas Day last year. And we were her primary caregivers along with my husband, and we fought and loved and struggled, and we talk about what we learned about ourselves and each other. And in this final episode of What’s on My Heart and Mind, I am so honored and grateful to share a conversation with you that I had with Vice President Kamala Harris.

[music]

BB: I want to say a few things about the podcast before we jump right into it. The first is I am an unapologetic Harris-Walz supporter. I have studied leadership for the last couple of decades. I have been inside of many, many of the Fortune 100 companies kind of in this country and around the world inside of NGOs, worked with military leaders. Leadership is something that’s really important to me. And this conversation is really the conversation that I insist on having with CEOs and executive directors and military commanders before I agree to do work within their organization. You know, if you take a CEO in corporate sector, I can listen to earnings calls, I can track stocks, I can read engagement data and performance data.

BB: But what’s really important to me is to sit down with a leader and understand their capacity for full presence, understand their values, understand what they believe in, why they’re fighting for what they’re fighting for. And that’s what this conversation is. I think Vice President Harris has done an incredible job, speaking to policy, writing about policy, if you go to her website, there’s detailed policy, everything from foreign policy, economic policy, abortion, guns, the things that matter from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep.

BB: This is a conversation about who is she, what does she believe in, why is she fighting. I will tell you that in terms of high performance, high stress leaders, I’ve met very few as solid as Vice President Harris. I’m excited to bring you into the conversation, Vice President Harris.

[music]

BB: Vice President Kamala Harris. Welcome to Unlocking Us.

VP Kamala Harris: It is so good to be with you, Dr. Brown.

BB: Thank you.

KH: It is so good to be with you, thank you.

BB: I’m just thrilled and ready to dig in.

KH: Me too.

BB: Okay, we’re going to start where we start all of these.

KH: Okay.

BB: Tell us your story, and start from the very beginning.

KH: Oh Lord, how much time do you have? [laughter]

BB: Well, we don’t have it… We, oh, you know. Five, 10 minutes. I mean, this is an important part because I’ve heard bits and pieces, but I wanted… I’m going to ask hard questions along the way.

KH: Okay, okay. So I am one of two daughters who, we were raised primarily by my mother. My parents divorced when I was five and I’m the eldest. And my mother had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer. She was a breast cancer researcher. And one of the very few women, and certainly one of the very few women of color.

BB: Wow.

KH: And a lot of my work on women’s health was formed, you know as I was growing up, listening to her and watching her passion about the need for women to have dignity in the healthcare system.

KH: We grew up in an incredible neighborhood where the kids, we would ride our bikes, just all of us together. You know, because the way we were all raised was just “Go out and play.”

BB: “Go, just go…”

KH: “Get out the house.”

BB: The bike gang.

KH: Right. And we did have the bike gang.

BB: Yeah.

KH: You got it.

BB: Oh yeah, no. Had the banana seat.

KH: Yes, I had my banana seat. [laughter] Seriously. Right? And then the tassels and… Right?

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: Oh, we were very serious about this.

BB: Yeah. And you knew where everyone was because there’d be 30 of those bikes in someone’s front yard.

KH: But, that’s exactly… And wherever you ended up around dinnertime is where you ate.

BB: That’s it.

KH: Right?

BB: Our house too. Oh yeah.

KH: Right? And so I had the blessing of a really great childhood because it was like it was a working class neighborhood of you know I try to explain to people have you ever known a neighborhood where people are… They’re proud of their lawn.

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: You know what I mean?

BB: Oh, yeah.

KH: Out there trimming their roses, out there mowing their lawn and just pride in neighborhood, pride in community. It was the kids of the community, we were raised where… I talk about this, which is that I had and have an incredible family, and it is the family that I have that is by blood, and it is the family that I have by love. And that’s how I was raised, that you create your family as much as you are born into your family, right?

BB: Right.

KH: And so I grew up with this expectation also… I joke about it, we were raised in a community of people that told all of us as kids that we were special. We weren’t particularly special. [laughter] But they told us we were and we believed them, right? And I think that in parenting, there are certain things that we do for the children in our lives that teachers do so beautifully, and that we can all do that is just about inspiring a kid to believe that they are loved and they are special. And then you create a high standard for them, and they know they’re supposed to rise to it.

BB: Oh God, yeah, I mean, I see you.

KH: Right?

BB: Yeah, and I see you and I know what you’re capable of and it’s tremendous.

KH: Yeah, and that’s it.

BB: That’s it. That’s it.

KH: And that’s it. And then when you do that, you know how kids are, especially like 12 and under, and you tell them that and they just start walking around with their chest out and their chin up. And that’s one of the best things you can give a child. And then you let them explore and you tell them they are special, which also means then we expect a lot of them.

BB: So I’m going to pause you here. Okay. Because this is, if you look at the parenting research, this follow-up piece is key, which is not you’re special and you don’t have to work at anything, not you’re special and you don’t have to do anything.

KH: No.

BB: You’re special.

KH: And therefore.

BB: Therefore.

KH: Yeah. I mean, I was part of… And I am like this, with our kids and with I have baby nieces who I just love to pieces. They’re my nieces’ children. And when you turn into like your 20s and then you look at your parents and you’re like, “These are all the things you did wrong,” right?

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: And I remember saying to my mother, “You never took my side,” because if I came home with any problem and talked to my mother about it, the first thing she would do was not, “Oh honey, come here. Let me hug you. Oh honey, let me take care of it.” The first thing she would do is look at you and say, “Well, what did you do? What’s your part?”

BB: That’s tough. She was leadership 101.

KH: But that’s right, because what I realized later is that she was teaching me and us that reflect on what your agency was at that moment and what was your responsibility and to the extent that you can control it, don’t let things happen to you.

BB: Okay, I have to pause you again here because this is my nerdy research thing.

KH: Yeah.

BB: Hope.

KH: Yeah.

BB: You know, people think hope is a gauzy emotion of possibility. Hope is actually mostly taught by parents in a learned cognitive behavioral process. What’s interesting about it is the positive correlation between hopefulness and a sense of agency.

KH: Yeah. As you say that, I see that.

BB: Yeah. So hope is actually three. This is C.R. Schneider’s work out of Kansas. Hope is goal. I can set a goal. Pathway. I can find a path to it.

KH: Right.

BB: That includes plan B, C, D, and E, if plan A doesn’t work.

KH: Right.

BB: And agency. I believe in my ability to do it. But this…

KH: And the hope is the driver.

BB: Hope is the driver.

KH: Exactly.

BB: But this pause that your mom made about, let’s talk about your agency here.

KH: In a way that also requires you to… I think it’s very important to also, in any situation and certainly it’s a rule for today among those who call themselves leaders, to then think about it in the context of reflection, because it also requires reflection.

BB: Say more.

KH: What happened? What could have happened? What role did I play in what happened?

BB: Oh, yeah.

KH: And what role did I play, it could be something where you should critically analyze it or to know that there’s a lesson learned, right? And I think that’s important.

BB: It’s courageous, I mean, it’s a hallmark of courageous leadership. It’s a hallmark of our leadership work is that your ability, anytime you’re giving corrective feedback or coaching to anticipate you’re going to have a part.

KH: Right, but that’s exactly right. And that’s right because as a leader, I’m very hard on myself. And one of the things that I feel and take very seriously is my responsibility to be prepared. Also, I’ve got this little thing about, it’s really important to me to be on time. Like someone teased me recently who’s worked with a lot of elected leaders. And like I’ve never seen an elected leader who is always on time. But I feel that I owe other people the respect of knowing their time is important.

BB: Yeah.

KH: Right? And the very least I can do is respect that in terms of what they’ve had to do in their day to meet with me, what they’ve had to put aside to do that. But there are these things that are about just what is your role in a moment of responsibility? And also duty. I gave a speech years ago about the distinction that I see between duty and charity, right?

BB: I’m making a face, y’all can’t see it, but I’m making a face.

KH: Right? And there’s a big difference.

BB: Yes, there’s a huge difference.

KH: Right? Charity kind of is… I mean, I’m oversimplifying it, obviously, but charity is, “Well, I have a little extra to give, and I will be benevolent, and I will give you some of what I have.” Duty is the responsibility that you have. It’s not an option.

BB: No.

KH: It is a responsibility. You should not expect to be applauded for it because it is actually what you are supposed to do. And I connect that to something I’ve seen my whole life and then most recently when I visited the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. And I went to a lot of the relief centers, and you’ve probably seen this.

BB: Oh yeah, Houstonian.

KH: Right. And what you’ve probably seen there, and I’ve seen throughout my life… It is often the case that the people who have the least to give, give the most.

BB: Yes, 100% of the time.

KH: Right?

BB: I mean, we actually see that in the research on charitable giving.

KH: Right. It’s incredible. It’s incredible. And that’s what I mean about duty. It’s not if you have. It’s I have two pennies. I give you one, right?

BB: Yeah, I mean, it makes me… It just makes me emotional as somebody who’s lived through a lot of that. You know, we’re Houstonians. We’ve seen it all go away. And it takes me back to Harvey.

KH: Wow.

BB: When the people getting us out of our home, were part of the Cajun Navy. They were fishermen.

KH: Right.

BB: Yeah. That came here in their F-150s, pulling their boats, gator fan boats, all kinds of stuff, with all kinds of interesting accoutrements on them.

KH: Yeah, of course.

BB: But they were putting us in those boats. And so, it is… I have to ask you a question.

KH: Sure.

BB: And you can just say I’m wrong.

KH: No, anything.

BB: I’m sensing some serious first-born energy here.

KH: Oh, for sure.

BB: It’s a first born!

[laughter]

BB: I’m like, I see you, I see you!

KH: You know, I was just talking with my team about this today. I try not to harp on it, but there is certainly something to birth order.

BB: There is. I mean, the research is so muddy, but every researcher who studies it goes “You know… we don’t know, but it’s true.” You know, it’s just, it’s just, yeah.

KH: Right. Well, like, I grew up from the age of two being told, “Look after your sister.”

BB: Yeah. I mean, I tell a story about… I am the oldest of four. And sometimes my therapist will say like, ‘This really inflated sense of importance.” And I was like, “When you grow up hearing, ‘Put the toilet lid down or your sisters will die,’”

KH: Right. [laughter]

BB: you get a pretty big sense of like, “Wow, every decision I make has pretty big consequences.”

KH: It has to. You’re absolutely right.

BB: Okay, I’ve got to ask you this question. You get to Howard. I heard it was a Houstonian, that termed, that created the term, is it C-cubed? Or three C…

KH: So C-cubed was my… C-cubed was the name that I was given by my sorority when I joined the sorority. We all had our nickname. And that was mine, and it stands for Cool, Calm, and Collected.

[laughter]

KH: So yes, that was a very long time ago, and that was the name I was given. Yes.

BB: I had to track it back because I actually started the research on the short haircut.

KH: Yeah. Oh, you did?

BB: Yeah, because someone sent it to me in this moment of excitement about you running and said “She had to have listened to Depeche Mode, look at the haircut, we’re going hard.” And I was like, “Okay, wait.”

KH: So let me just tell you, my husband loves Depeche Mode and I am not, it’s not my thing.

BB: It’s not your thing?

KH: It’s just, so that’s funny you say that. But I did have that shortcut, but that was like those days, it was those days.

BB: I had a shortcut too, ’86.

KH: But you know what, you’re right. Well, so the person who kind of managed our sorority when I joined was a Houstonian. So yes.

BB: I love this story.

KH: Yes, yes.

BB: Okay, first time you fell in love.

KH: Oh, goodness. In high school. [laughter]

BB: Did you?

KH: Yeah.

BB: Did you get your heart broken or did you break someone’s heart?

KH: I don’t… I didn’t get my heart broken. I kind of just, I went to college. But there’s also, I mean, my best friend from kindergarten is still one of my best friends.

BB: Oh, you’re kidding.

KH: No, in fact, she’s been out campaigning for me in North Carolina knocking on doors.

BB: Let’s go.

KH: Right? I love my girlfriends. We have a sisterhood. I have my sister and in addition my chosen sisters, who we have traveled life together, right? I am godmother to their children. Our husbands are like brothers, right? And it’s a big part of my life. It’s a big part of my life. And it’s a big part of probably my sanity.

BB: Oh, for sure.

KH: Right?

BB: Yes. Yes.

KH: You know, and in fact, I tell women… I mentor a lot of women and men. And I say this to the youngest though, including our kids, including younger adults, “Know that…” Again, this gets back to agency, “Know you have a choice to decide who will be in your friend circle and choose those people who are going to root for you, those people who are not going to judge you but at the same time are going to say, ‘Girl, you need a mint.’” [laughter]

BB: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

KH: Those who will laugh with you when you trip and fall, and then they’ll pull you back up and push you out. And sometimes I just simplify it this way, because I did that a long time ago in my life. I’m not going to have mean friends.

BB: No.

KH: But you have to be intentional about these things, right?

BB: You do. Especially if you ever experience… I mean one of the things that we do with our kids is we do this little metaphor where we have them put a little like pretend there’s a flame in their hand and say when you get really bright and shine, make sure you don’t hang out with anyone that comes by and blows it out because your light is too bright.

KH: Oh, that’s beautiful. I like that.

BB: Yeah, just like you want someone that says “Hey man, you’re shining. Let me help you block the wind for a minute.”

KH: Right. And that’s right. And we have to teach and including other adults.

BB: Yes.

KH: You actually… you have the right to not have mean people in your life.

BB: Yeah.

KH: And to sit back and actually be intentional about how do people make you feel, and it doesn’t mean that people are just blowing smoke up.

BB: That feels bad too, actually.

KH: Right. And it does.

BB: But yes, people feel bad too.

KH: And it absolutely does. And it will not take you to a good place.

BB: No.

KH: Right?

BB: And there’s no trust in that.

KH: No. But there’s not, and there’s no safety in that either, right?

BB: Yeah. It’s really interesting. I saw a quote the other day that said, “How someone treats you says more about you than them. How you allow them to treat you says more about you.”

KH: That’s great.

BB: Yeah. And I think that’s true. And I think that’s adult friendships, like you said, it’s walking a very difficult path.

KH: Right. But you have to be intentional about it.

BB: You have to be intentional.

KH: And this is not like a television program where it’s just going to happen because you just end up being someone’s roommate.

BB: Right.

KH: Right?

BB: No. It’s work.

KH: Yeah.

BB: Relationships.

KH: It is. And it is work. And friendships are work. And it’s work that’s good work. It’s work that can be joyful work. And important.

BB: And it can be hard.

KH: Yeah. It can be hard. But…

BB: Sisterhood’s the same way, don’t you think?

KH: But it is.

BB: Yeah.

KH: Of course.

BB: Yeah. I mean, I’ve had some of the most, Ashley and Barrett are two of the most important people in my life…

KH: You have two sisters?

BB: I have two. They’re identical twins.

KH: Wow.

BB: Oh yeah. When my parents brought them home in New Orleans, I was like, “Holy crap. Are both of them staying?” Like, this is a…

KH: Oh, how old were you when they were born?

BB: Eight. And my brother’s between us. And so…

KH: Oh wow. Okay. And so you’re close to your brother?

BB: Yeah. Code name; Sister Superior. Yeah.

KH: Oh my God.

BB: But that’s okay.

KH: That’s great.

BB: I got, but…

KH: All three of them call you Sister Superior?

BB: Only on occasion. And only once. [laughter]

KH: Yeah. And usually around like a Thanksgiving dinner? [laughter]

BB: Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. We just did a podcast, the one before this is with my sisters about my mom’s death.

KH: Oh yeah.

BB: And kind of, there was a funny moment where I said, “Well, no, I just wanted it to go this way.” And I said, “What did you want Ashley?” And Ashley said, “I just wanted you to stop telling me what to do mostly.” I was like, “That’s my job.”

KH: Well, you and I have had that experience of our mothers passing.

BB: Yeah. Ugh.

KH: And what that… and during an illness, what that does, right? Because it’s interesting, the relationship between adult siblings in the context of your parents can have the effect of having you revert to your 12-year-old self. [laughter]

BB: Oh, my God. I mean, all of a sudden. Right. Like Scooby-Doo is on. And it’s like…

KH: You can lead the world, but you are just back to being 12. [laughter]

BB: Yeah. No, in a heartbeat.

KH: Yep. Yeah. It’s not pretty.

BB: They push the buttons because they installed them.

KH: Exactly. That’s good.

BB: Yeah. So.

KH: Oh, you’ve got… I just feel I should be writing notes right now. [laughter]

BB: Yeah. Yeah. No, I read a lot. I read a lot of quotes. Okay. I’m going to transition to leadership because I have a question for you.

KH: Sure.

BB: So, we’ve been studying like courageous leadership, daring leadership, for 15 years.

KH: Yeah. Yeah.

BB: We have found that daring leaders often have one or two values that are core to them. And we all have a lot of values. But one or two that are core where every other value is forged. What would you say as a leader that your primary one or two values… How would you identify them?

KH: Yeah. They’re probably directly connected. Fairness and justice.

BB: Wow. I would have never, that’s so powerful.

KH: That’s really, really important to me.

BB: Fairness and justice.

KH: Yeah. I mean, it prompts me to act if I see something that is unjust or unfair. And at the same time, fighting for that… for others is something that is a real motivator of mine and actually will cause me to have a very, almost emotional feeling about the importance of it.

BB: Fairness and justice. Okay. Another leadership question. I’ve been watching you. [laughter] You’re making a funny face.

KH: Yikes. Okay. [laughter]

BB: No. And it’s interesting. I see in you… There’s a generational difference in leadership.

KH: Yeah.

BB: So, folks who are 10, 15, 20 years older than us come from a brand of leadership that is very command and control. It’s somewhat ego protective. And our generation is kind of caught in between that and highly collaborative.

KH: Right.

BB: Highly coalition building.

KH: Absolutely.

BB: And in the best moments surrounding ourselves by experts who are high performers, have deep knowledge and understanding and great strategy skills.

KH: Yeah.

BB: You seem to move toward coalition and collaborative leadership. Is that a fair assessment?

KH: Very much, very much.

BB: Say more, say more.

KH: My lived experience is to know that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. And okay. So Gen Z and others will kind of, they’ve got this whole meme about me and my, dare I say, obsession with Venn diagrams.

[laughter]

KH: I love Venn diagrams.

BB: Ain’t nobody over forty that doesn’t like a Venn diagram. Y’all just get used to it.

KH: I love.

BB: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

KH: I love Venn diagram…

BB: We love a Venn. We love a Venn.

KH: Like, if you’re faced with conflict, pull out a Venn diagram.

BB: And the matte pencils to color. Yes.

KH: I’m telling you. In fact, when my goddaughter went to college, she’s now a sophomore, and she comes and stays with me from time to time, because we’re both on the East Coast right now. And it was one of her first weekends in her freshman year. And she’s like, “Auntie, I’ve got…” And it’s all these different groups. And she’s trying to, and I was like, “Honey, we’re going to pull out the Venn diagram.”

[laughter]

KH: That Venn diagram had about 11 circles on it though.

[laughter]

BB: Perfect. I mean, that’s it.

KH: And I was like, “Okay, we’re going to going to figure out where’s the intersection and then let’s figure out where you’re going to fit into it.” I literally still have this Venn diagram. But I just think that if we work toward coalition building, we are stronger as a society. I just know it. And I know that when you bring together seemingly different people and you bring people around a table you can watch. And it’s so exciting. You watch how the silos break down.

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: And everyone leaves a bit taller.

BB: For sure. Seen, heard, valued, contributed.

KH: And you know, part of the struggle that I think we have increasingly in this society as it is evolving and in some ways, devolving. People are feeling alone. And when you feel alone, it’s very disempowering. And when we can bring people together and they see the commonality, it is then empowering of the individual as well as what it does for the collective.

BB: That’s right.

KH: Right?

BB: That’s right. I mean that’s actually the secret sauce of high performing teams. And it doesn’t matter whether I’m working with a corporate team, an NGO team, a military special… that that is, you’re not alone. And we are more alike than we’re different.

KH: Right.

BB: I have to say something now because I’m getting… I’m trying to win the over-under on not cussing during the podcast, but…

KH: Go for it. Just go for it.

BB: No, no. I have to say this, what you’re describing is very different than what I saw from the previous Trump administration. And certainly a stark difference in what he’s committing to do in the next four years if he’s president. And I want to talk about something really specific. And this is very difficult for me just as a woman, as a person, but also someone who has studied leadership for decades.

KH: Yeah.

BB: He’s talking about loyalists, not experts in positions of authority. People that will serve him, not our country, including most recently a comment about using the military against Americans who disagree with him.

KH: The enemy within. He talks about the enemy within American citizens.

BB: I have to catch my breath for a second. I have to understand, or I want to understand, I don’t have to understand, but I want to understand. If I were working in an organization, a Fortune 100 company, and I saw a leader surrounding himself or herself with loyalists, who serve a person rather than a mission and a purpose and shareholders or a board, that would last five seconds.

KH: Right. Right, right.

BB: Do you think this fear about putting loyalists in place is a real fear?

KH: It is a very real fear. And we have heard… Look, the people who know Donald Trump best, who worked with him, members of his political party, who worked with him inside the Oval Office, inside the Situation Room, who were his chief of staff most recently, the one who spoke out, a four star Marine general, his national security advisor, two secretaries of defense, and his former vice president have all said he is unfit to serve as president and he is dangerous. Donald Trump is someone who has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States. I have taken the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States six times; twice as DA, twice as attorney general, as a United States senator, and now as vice president.

KH: There are very few oaths… one that you make to your spouse, to God… but to the Constitution of the United States is the highest duty, the most sacred duty that any office holder, especially president of the United States. And this man says he would terminate the Constitution of the United States. And talking about enemies within, I mean, that harkens back to like McCarthyism.

BB: No, it, yeah. I mean, it’s like a straight line. It’s a short line. It’s a short walk.

KH: Yeah. And so the fear is real and legitimate and very well founded. But what I urge everyone to do is do something with that fear, which is understand that we, as long as we hold onto it, have a democracy. And in a democracy in our country, the people have the power through their vote, to determine who will be their leaders and who will be president of the United States and the direction of our country right now, we are truly at an inflection point. We are truly at an inflection point.

BB: I believe that. And I see it, and I just did a two-part special with Heather Cox Richardson, the great…

KH: Yeah. She’s so wonderful.

BB: Yeah. The historian.

KH: Historian. Yeah.

BB: And she, among many historians right now are just reminding voters that authoritarian rule does not come into power with 1950s grainy black and white movies of tanks rolling in, or guns being held to people’s heads. In almost, I mean, if you look at Hungary, if you look at… I mean, like, what’s happening is we vote someone in.

KH: Yep.

BB: And so this, yeah. The enemy within. Can I run something by you?

KH: Anything.

BB: It’s a theory that I have about what I see going on. And I see it from a different perspective than probably political. Because I study human behavior and emotion.

KH: Yeah.

BB: I actually get the attraction of the Trump/Vance approach, and I’m going to tell you why I get it. I get it because we are not neurobiologically hardwired for uncertainty. Antonio Damasio is a neuroscientist. He always said, “Don’t ever believe that we’re thinking machines who have feelings. We are feeling machines who on occasion think.” And so…

KH: Which is the key to the survival of the species.

BB: Right. Which is the key to the survival of the species. And so what ends up happening, I think with this kind of what we we’re seeing with Trump and Vance especially, is, it is really good reality television. It is kind of what we would call in the social sciences, emotional pornography, that the country is somewhat numb to a base level of emotion. I think because we’ve been through so much in the last few years, that it takes extraordinary emotion to get our attention. And the bigger and the blustery, the emotion. And what ends up happening is a strategy of emotional, just kind of emotional nuttiness.

BB: And, “We’re going to win and we’re going to do this.” And everybody’s like, “Yes.” And then you, I find you standing in front of not fans with hats on that match your campaign, but undecided voters talking about the Middle East and Ukraine and economic policy.

KH: Yeah.

BB: And that is… I mean, really, I hate this metaphor, but I am a fifth generation Texan. My grandpa would say, “Damn girl, you brought, you brought a knife to a gunfight.”

KH: Right.

BB: Like you’re talking. You’re talking policy. You’re talking, you’re actually talking about what’s going to, in my opinion, and I’m not being overwrought here. You’re talking about the things that I believe could keep my children alive.

KH: Yeah. That’s my intention.

BB: Especially my daughter.

KH: That’s my intention.

BB: So, you’re talking about how it’s going to work.

KH: And I’m going to tell you something, we are going to win. It is not going to be easy. We are going to win. I believe that the majority of Americans not only love our country deeply…

BB: I believe that.

KH: Right. But understand that at the end of the day, the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It’s based on who you lift up. It’s what we teach our kids. It’s what we want in leaders in terms of how they look at us and think about us. And you know, I talk about it on the campaign trail because I truly believe people are exhausted with the Trump era. They’re done. That no matter what the differences between us, we know that it is not healthy. And it does not strengthen us as a nation to have Americans pointing their fingers at each other.

BB: No. I mean, not only is it exhausting, it is…

KH: It’s debilitating.

BB: It’s debilitating. And it’s somewhat traumatizing, to track that level of emotionality and rhetoric, especially, in the study of power, we talk about power over versus power with and power to. And in the type of leadership you’re talking…

KH: I talk about that in freedom. Freedom from, freedom to.

BB: Yes. Yes. Exactly. And so the leadership you’re talking about is power with and to.

KH: Yeah.

BB: The problem with power over, there’s a lot of problems with it, but the biggest thing I’ve seen over the past 20 years of my career is, to maintain power over, you have to be willing to exercise occasional cruelty…

KH: That’s right.

BB: Against vulnerable populations. Otherwise you don’t lose that fear that power over depends on. And…

KH: But the cruelty…

BB: Yeah. The cruelty.

KH: Is a key part of what you were talking about.

BB: And that’s traumatizing for us.

KH: Yes it is. And it is demeaning, but it is also… It’s traumatizing in what we know. What you know. I mean you’re the expert at this table. Trauma, it numbs the individual. It numbs the people. And when we are numb, we will not achieve our capacity, not to mention we will not achieve not only our capacity in terms of productivity, but in terms of a quality of life. I mean, I think about it and I think it is an important thing to think about. You know, what brings you joy? I think that’s important.

BB: Oh my god. It’s key.

KH: Right? And think of it this way, if you’ve ever tried to talk with someone who’s depressed and you try to literally and figuratively open the curtains and say, “Look, it’s the sun’s out. It’s a beautiful day.” And they can’t see it. And there is something about trauma that is very similar in terms of it blunts our senses and ability to see the good, the things that will bring joy. It’s not healthy. And so we have to, to your point, diagnose it. And we have to treat it. And one of the ways to treat it ultimately, is not only to deal with the symptoms, but deal with the cause.

BB: Cause. Yeah.

KH: And that’s what I’m trying to do.

BB: I want to talk to you about this because I think this is interesting. One of the emotional pulls, that my friends… I’ve talked to a lot of people preparing for the interview. Some because that’s what I do.

[laughter]

BB: But like just the research, and some undecided, some voting for you but thinking, “Should I mobilize and just like really get after it and fight?” And I’m like, ‘Yes, we should.”

KH: Yes. Yes.

BB: I want to talk about the emotional pornography that’s being used and the false narratives. So, part of the narrative that’s really being used, I think by some extremists and not all, because let me tell you, I have an awkward family table at Thanksgiving. Like I’ve got people all, I mean, again, this comes with the territory of the fifth generation Texan, right?

BB: I don’t know how to say out loud. When you think you’re the party or the people who own toughness, God, patriotism, responsible gun ownership, and family. Then anyone who disagrees with you is not patriotic…

KH: That’s interesting.

BB: Hates God, is weak and not tough. And what is crazy about that is… not true.

KH: Yeah.

BB: So can I take them one by one with you?

KH: Of course. Of course, of course.

BB: There was a moment at the Democrat National Convention when I saw this still photo of you, and below you were people holding signs that say, “We fight and we win.” And I was like, “This is one of the first people in my party to acknowledge that we have to fight to win.”

KH: Yep. Oh yeah.

BB: You’re not afraid…

KH: Nope.

BB: Of owning the fact that sometimes winning takes fighting.

KH: Absolutely. And here’s how I think about that. If you know what you stand for, then you know what to fight for. It’s not fighting for the sake of fighting.

BB: Say that again.

KH: If you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. I stand for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body. I stand for the fact that we should treat each other with dignity and respect. I stand for the proposition that we need to lift up working people and give them access to opportunity. These are the kinds of things I stand for. So, I fight for them.

BB: And if you look at the history, I think of our party, the expansion of liberty and justice, the protection of people and the values we hold dear.

KH: Of course.

BB: We are tough as nails.

KH: Right.

BB: So, I love the fact that you’re unapologetic, if you say that, if you know what you stand for…

KH: You know what to fight for.

BB: You know what to fight for. And I tell the second image, and this is gets kind of complicated, but this is in my jam right here.

[laughter]

BB: This was seeing how much the Walz children adored their dad.

KH: I know.

BB: And it was beautiful. And I thought for a moment, Carl Jung said that paradox, this ability to hold seemingly contradictory things, is the most important spiritual gift we have, and the closest thing that captures the truth to being human. And when I saw you fight to win, and I saw the Walz family, what I thought is “These are not different things.”

KH: Nope.

BB: These are born of the courage to love and the courage to lead.

KH: You’re absolutely right. And you hit it on the head because it is not only if you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. If you love, you know what to fight for.

BB: Yeah.

KH: And I know this is going to sound corny, but I love our country.

BB: You really do.

KH: I do.

BB: I can tell.

KH: I do. And I believe in the promise of America. I am empirical evidence of the promise of America. I know what we can do. I know what… I believe in the foundational principles, and maybe that’s being trained as a lawyer. And one of the reasons I wanted to become a lawyer, I believe that we can make true all of those words we spoke about our commitment to equality, to liberty, to justice. I believe in all that. But none of it will come without us being vigilant. No, it won’t. You know, on democracy. Look, I think there’s a duality to its nature, right? On one hand, strength. When a democracy is intact, what it does to protect the rights and the freedoms and the liberties of its people. Incredible strength.

BB: Yeah.

KH: On the other hand, incredibly fragile.

BB: There’s a fragility.

KH: It will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. I guess that’s your point also about the duality in terms of the paradox.

BB: Paradox. Yeah.

KH: Yeah. That’s.

BB: It’s a paradox.

KH: That’s right. Yeah.

BB: I want to say something else about in this kind of like fake narratives that are just not true and emotionally resonant for people, but untrue. No party gets God. Like I love God. I mean, I taught vacation Bible school.

[laughter]

BB: There is no long term evaluation of how those kids are doing or whether they’re all still okay. But like, I love God. And if you measure your faith and your commitment to the sacred, not by proclamation…

KH: I’m with you. I’m so with you.

BB: But by the willingness to protect the most vulnerable among us.

KH: By deed and deed. Faith in your works.

BB: Faith, oh my God, I was just going to say that. Faith without action.

KH: No.

BB: Like, so I don’t care how much you say you love God.

KH: I’m so with you. And I have never… I have as an elected person purposely not talked a lot because I just find that the people who do tend to be hypocrites.

BB: Oh, yeah.

KH: And I was raised, I was raised in the Black church. I was raised to believe in a loving God. And the God that I believe in and pray to is a God that says, “Do justice, have mercy…”

BB: Do good.

KH: It is about do good. It is about feed the hungry. It is about care for the poor and the elderly. It is about love thy neighbor. It is about the Good Samaritan who in the face… I mean, that’s one of my favorite, the parable of the Good Samaritan, which is, my way of talking about it is that we should in the face of a stranger, see a neighbor, right?

BB: Beautiful. Yeah.

KH: And getting back to what I saw in terms of the relief centers after Hurricane Helene.

BB: That’s it.

KH: That is doing the work of living your faith. I like to say faith is a verb.

BB: For sure. I mean…

KH: Because it is about knowing something even when you can’t see it. But it is also about then manifesting it, right? And then making it real. And so then that’s when you see faith and you have faith, right? When you see it in the works and the deeds as an expression of your deeply held beliefs.

BB: Yes. I mean, yes. And just for the record, this is from me. Don’t quote her quote me. You don’t get God, like, like no party gets God, no group gets God.

KH: No. No, of course not.

BB: Like that’s a terrible way to weaponize God. And it’s just not what we’re talking about. And I feel, I have to tell you, I feel the same way about the co-opting of patriotism.

KH: Yeah, I agree.

BB: Like, I think patriotism is protest, disagreement, debate.

KH: And it is the highest form of patriotism, I believe, to fight for the ideals of our country.

BB: Yes. That fragile and strong democracy.

KH: That’s exactly right. And so in this election, fighting for free and fair elections, fighting for the fact that we will have a president who does not aspire to be a dictator, admiring people like the president of Russia. We will have in our leaders, those who vow to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States, not terminate it. Isn’t that… Aren’t those examples of what we believe patriotism to be, which is the love of our country, understanding the oath and the responsibility in particular that elected leaders have?

BB: That’s it.

KH: To foundational principles?

BB: I have to read this to you, because when I read this, I heard about it on the news. But when I read the National Security Leaders for America letter.

KH: Yeah.

BB: So, I do a ton of work with the military and with veterans. I know some of the people who signed this letter. These people are not kidding around.

KH: And they’re not political people.

BB: They’re not political people. And if they were, I would imagine they were probably conservative Republicans, to be honest with you.

KH: I agree with you.

BB: Yeah. And so I just want to read part of it. “We are former public servants.” This is on September 22nd, 2024. “We are former public servants who swore on oath to the Constitution. Many of us risked our lives for it. We are retired generals, admirals, senior non-commissioned officers, ambassadors, and senior civilian national security leaders. We are Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. We are loyal to the ideals of our nation, like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. Not to any individual or party. We do not agree on everything. But we all adhere to two fundamental principles. First, we believe an America’s national security requires a serious and capable commander in chief. Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable. Each generation has a responsibility to defend it. That is why we, the undersigned proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States. This election is a choice between serious leadership and vengeful impulsiveness. It is a choice between democracy and authoritarianism. Vice President Harris defends America’s democratic ideals while former President Donald Trump endangers them.”

KH: So I, as vice president of the United States, I have now met over 150 world leaders; presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. Many of them multiple times, we’re on a first name basis. When we walk in those rooms around the world, representing the United States of America, we have traditionally been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority, to talk about things like democracy and rule of law.

BB: That’s right.

KH: But being a role model means people watch what you do, to see if it matches up to what you say.

BB: And look for one opportunity to dismiss.

KH: What otherwise imperfect though we may be, is a gold standard, if not the gold standard. And I will tell you that part of my hope and prayer for us as a country, is that among the stakes that we understand are at play in this election, that we all understand how important America is to the rest of the world. I really, I hope, and I pray we fully understand what we mean to the rest of the world, where people in various parts of the world are fighting for democracy. Where women are fighting for their ability to be educated, to have rights. And so, these national security leaders having their support and endorsement, I’m deeply honored, but it also is testament to the fact that just like John Kelly, recently speaking out publicly about his concerns about Trump and fascism and all of that think of their letter as a 911 call to the American people.

BB: It took my breath away.

KH: Yeah.

BB: They talked about your steadfastness in the situation room, they talked about your toughness, and they talked with real fear about what would happen. That Trump would remain absolutely unchecked and has developed relationships far deeper than what we understand with some of the most dangerous people threatening everything we believe in.

KH: And this is not 2016 or 2020.

BB: No.

KH: He is also increasingly unstable and unhinged. And the significance of even the words that you read about… I asked people to imagine we can all picture the Oval Office. You’ve seen it on TV. Imagine the Oval Office in your head, just imagine it on January 20th, 2025. If Donald Trump is sitting there, he will be stewing over his enemies list.

BB: Oh, I think that’s true. People talk about their fear.

KH: Versus what I intend to do, which is sitting there thinking of the American people working on my to-do list. There’s is a big difference.

BB: Oh the gotcha list and the to-do list.

KH: Mm hmm.

BB: I mean, this goes back to the difference of loyalists to serve him.

KH: That’s right.

BB: And experts.

KH: We’ve come full circle.

BB: Yes.

KH: That’s right.

BB: So, fifth generation Texan. I cannot let you out of this conversation without saying that I’m really scared for the women in my state.

KH: Yeah.

BB: I’m scared for my daughter. I spoke Monday in San Antonio to 7500 educators. And I want to tell you something that really was devastating to me. On stage I was asked by the person facilitating the conversation what I thought about the fact that some of their members, these educators did not come because it was being held in San Antonio, and they would not come because of the Machiavellian abortion laws here.

KH: Yeah.

BB: And I thought, “Well, I believe in standing up for what you believe in.” And as it turns out, I can barely talk about it. I mean, as it turns out, many of the women who chose not to come actually chose not to come because they are pregnant.

KH: I know. And I assumed that’s where you’re going. Because I’ve heard…

BB: Yeah. They were afraid.

KH: There are a lot of….

BB: If something happened.

KH: There are a lot of pregnant women who do not want to travel to states with Trump abortion bans for exactly that reason. That God forbid something happens, God forbid they are experiencing a difficulty with their pregnancy or miscarriage.

BB: Yeah, like clotting or bleeding.

KH: Absolutely.

BB: Then all of a sudden their choices are, go to jail or die.

KH: It’s, again, this gets back to the fact that we must be vigilant, and we have to remember that we can never take our rights for granted. Back to your point about talking with folks about whether they should get very activated around this election and knock on doors and tell people why they care and why it matters and why they should vote. This is the day, this is the time.

BB: This is the fight.

KH: Because this is, this is. And I mean the fundamental, the notion that in the United States of America in this year of our Lord 2024, that women don’t have the right to make decisions about their own body. I mean, what could be more fundamental? We’re not talking about property rights. We’re literally talking about the right to make decisions about your own body. And in Texas, the law provides up to prison for life for a physician, a healthcare provider, for performing the care that they deem in the best interest of their patient.

KH: And can you imagine what’s happening now is that I’ve talked to a lot of physicians and medical school professors…

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: And they’re seeing a decline in their postdocs…

BB: For sure.

KH: Who want to go into family… or go into family medicine in particular reproductive healthcare because these students they don’t want to go to states… And that we now have 20 states with Trump abortion bans. And you already look at the fact that we still have the sad reality of America is we still have the highest rate of maternal mortality of any so-called wealthy nation. If you look at the reasons behind that, it includes the lack of appropriate and adequate care for women in the context of their reproductive systems.

BB: Yes.

KH: Whether it be pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, postpartum. We have so many deserts. We call them deserts for maternal care.

BB: Oh yeah.

KH: And you have then the effect that includes that people don’t want to go into reproductive healthcare. I’m the first vice president and never has there been a president who’s gone to a reproductive health clinic. I wanted to go, because I wanted to highlight the fact that in these clinics also, it’s not only abortion care; that’s where they do Paps. They do breast cancer screenings. I mean, they do HIV screenings.

BB: I saw nobody except a Planned Parenthood nurse practitioner for 15 years.

KH: Exactly right. And because you knew, and so many people know, you walk into that clinic and that’s where you’re going to be treated with dignity. You’re not going to be judged. It’s a safe place. That’s what these clinics offer. Usually they are run by women and they’re closing, in many places because of the laws that are present in those states. And so you’re talking about so many ramifications, whether it be students going into to medical practice for reproductive care, whether it be clinics closing, whether it be pregnant women not wanting to travel, whether it be kids like some of my godchildren who in high school, are making college application decisions based on which state.

BB: Oh, for sure.

KH: Right? The ramifications of this highlight a fact, which is that Donald Trump threw his decision to put those three members on the Supreme Court to undo Roe, has created a healthcare crisis in America. This is a healthcare crisis.

BB: This is a healthcare crisis for sure. Okay. Our time is up. I’m getting a sign.

KH: Darn.

BB: I’m getting a sign. We could keep going, but.

KH: I know like I could sit here and talk to you all afternoon.

[laughter]

BB: Yeah. I’m going to end with something that we always end up with it, which is part of the rapid fire. Just one question.

KH: Okay.

BB: A snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that gives you true joy.

KH: Sunday family dinner, hands down. In my normal life, I love to cook. And Sunday family dinner is non-negotiable. Everyone comes, whoever’s in town, they can bring their friends. And I cook. We have our routines. Sunday family dinner, hands down.

BB: I love a Sun… We have a big Sunday family dinner too.

KH: Really?

BB: I mean, we hold hands and sing Grace. It’s the whole thing, right?

KH: Really?

BB: Yeah. We do. Yeah. I will say the snapshot of an ordinary moment in my life that gives me true joy is you and your commitment to justice. And your commitment to duty and service. And I am as activated as I can be. And I…

KH: Thank you for your voice. I said it to you before we started the program, but you give voice to so many people who rightly must be seen and heard and talk about leadership. What you do with your voice and your platform is really build community in a very important way. And I thank you for that because that’s in the best interest of all of us. So thank you. And it’s great to be with you. I look forward to talking with you again.

BB: I do too. Let’s fight and win.

KH: Yes, we will.

BB: Okay.

[music]

BB: I really appreciate y’all being here for the conversation. I learned a lot about… I guess I was surprised in some ways, I don’t know why, about her values. It completely checks out that fairness and justice are the deep, deep core values that she turns to when things are tough. We all have many values, but there’s normally we have found in our research, one or two, that is the space where all other values are forged. And it means something to me to have a leader of this democracy that’s committed to justice and fairness, that’s committed to building a collaborative, high performing, strategic leadership team around her. Rather than a team of loyalists that don’t serve the country, but serve the leader. I think in any other sector, where you and I would be at work or in nonprofits, wherever we go every day, the team of loyals has never gone down in global history as courageous, meaningful leadership. I hope you vote. I hope you take seriously the oath that maybe we have not taken because we are not formal elected leaders, but the oath that we all take as citizens in a democracy. I’m grateful for you. I’m grateful for this community. Stay awkward, brave, and kind. And vote.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,What Kamala Harris *Still* Means to Me as Young Indian American Woman - Ms. Magazine,"In July, I wrote an article about what Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy meant to me as a young Indian American woman. I woke up on Wednesday, Nov. 6, with a heavy heart. In light of her loss, I want to revisit what she still means to me.

Harris notably did not make her race and gender a central point in her campaign, so I do not mean to reduce her to those identifiers. Throughout her short race, though, she exemplified an experience I am sure many women of color identify with: shouldering the double burden of racism and sexism while being held to a double standard of composure and perfection.

Harris fielded racist questions about whether she was really Black; she calmly ignored sexist remarks from politicians and pundits alike; she rose above commentary degrading her intelligence; and she did all of this with firm resolve. For some of us, it was maddening to see her “go high,” as Michelle Obama would say. But Harris was demonstrating to all of us—women and men alike—what it is like to lead with conviction, grace and empathy. And till the end she was not shy to embrace her mother’s immigrant roots, as she did in this video celebrating her mother who came to this country at the age of 19. For this, I thank her.

Vice President Kamala Harris has paved the way for the next woman of color—a Black woman, Latina woman, Asian American woman, Indigenous woman—to run for president and move us further towards justice and equality for all. Hopefully, because of Kamala Harris, she will not have to be as perfect. Hopefully, because of Kamala Harris, she will win.

In her concession speech, Vice President Harris spoke of an old adage: “Only when it is dark enough, can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here’s the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.”

Hearing this after Diwali, the Hindu celebration of the triumph of good over evil, of light over dark, gave me chills.

It may be a long time before I see an Indian American woman run for president again. Meanwhile, as Harris suggested in her gracious concession, I will work to find light in the dark alongside incredible young women whom I hope will one day shatter all of those ceilings.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Vice President Kamala Harris: Truth and Service to America - The Dig,"No matter the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, one thing is certain. Upon her election as vice president of the United States, Kamala Devi Harris became the highest-ranking woman ever in public service. On Harris’ journey to history, she has broken barrier after barrier and shattered glass ceilings into millions of pieces. Most recently, she became the first HBCU graduate to ever receive a major presidential nomination.

For other institutions, she might represent an anomaly of excellence. At Howard, she is simply a part of our lineage of leadership.

Because you went to Howard University, you have a responsibility to keep reaching for that bar and keep serving.”

In the expansive temporal tome that is Howard history, Harris occupies plenty of pages; First Black district attorney of San Francisco; First Black and first woman of South Asian descent to become a United States senator from California. The only woman to be part of a winning presidential ticket.

Harris has always made it crystal clear that her public service is “for the people,” meaning all of the people. However, her HBCU roots are dear to her, and she has seized every opportunity to uplift her Alma Mater. After she launched her first run for the presidency in 2019, she held her first press conference at Howard. Throughout her vice presidency, she returned many times to discuss economic empowerment and reproductive rights. She tossed the opening coin at the 2023 Celebration Bowl in Atlanta, during which the Howard Bison took on the Florida A&M Rattlers, and invited Bison athletes to visit her in the Naval Observatory.

She came back home to Howard many times during her historic 2024 presidential campaign, using the campus as a place of comfort and renewal. In so many meaningful ways, both high profile and subtle, she has shown her devotion to her Alma Mater and her interest in its continued advancement. Tens of thousands of Bison around the country are extremely proud and grateful.

Much of her success can be attributed to her tight embrace of Howard’s core principles of truth and service. She reinforced the importance of this principle when talking to Howard graduates at the University’s 149th Commencement ceremony in 2017.

“Speaking the truth means you must speak up, and you must speak out, even when you are not asked,” she said. “Even when it is uncomfortable or inconvenient.”",Vice President Kamala Harris: Truth and Service to America  The Dig,The Dig,https://thedig.howard.edu/all-stories/vice-president-kamala-harris-truth-and-service-america
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results - Brookings Institution,"Trump won a personal victory in the 2024 election, sweeping all the swing states, improving his vote share just about everywhere, and—unlike his 2016 victory—garnering an outright majority of the popular vote. In addition, he led the Republican Party to a larger-than-expected Senate majority and, although many House races remain to be called, an expanded House majority may result as well. These gains are more than incremental; indeed, they may signal a new era in American politics.

Political scientists and historians will spend years analyzing the causes and significance of this election. My focus is more immediate. Although the data are imperfect and incomplete, I will offer preliminary answers to two questions, which are really two sides of the same coin: Why did Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election, and why did Kamala Harris lose?

Trump’s victory

Donald Trump’s theory of the case was broadly correct. He and his campaign managers believed that it was possible to build on Republicans’ growing strength among white working-class voters to create a multi-ethnic working-class coalition. He was right: If the exit polls turn out to be accurate, he made strides among Latinos and African Americans, especially men. He increased his share of the Black male vote from 12% to 20% and carried Hispanic men by nine points, 54% to 45%.

The Trump campaign also believed that they could improve their performance among young adults, and they did—from 35% in 2020 to 42% this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of this gain reflected a shift toward Trump among young men. Trump spent lots of time on podcasts, such as Joe Rogan’s, whose principal audiences are this otherwise hard-to-reach group.

After the Republican primaries, the victorious Trump forces faced a choice: They could moderate their message to reach out to disappointed backers of Nikki Haley, who ran a traditional Reagan conservative campaign, or they could continue their all-out appeal to the Republican base while enjoying the grudging support of his defeated adversary. They chose the latter course and won the gamble that the party would unite around them. Donald Trump received 94% of the Republican vote and as a bonus, reduced the Democratic edge among Independents from nine points in 2020 to five points this year.

The Trump campaign’s tactical choices paid off. Three turned out to be critical. First: Convinced that Trump’s intense personal bond with his supporters would do most of the mobilizing work, the campaign decided not to invest heavily in traditional get-out-the-vote organizing and instead outsourced it to supporting organizations. Although the Harris campaign touted its advantage in the “ground game,” there is little evidence that it made much of a difference.

Second: The Trump campaign decided that Harris’ stance on transgender issues was the Willie Horton of 2024 and invested heavily in negative advertising that dominated the airwaves throughout the South.1 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this campaign helped weaken Harris’ effort to portray herself as a common-sense center-left candidate rather than an emissary from San Francisco.

Third: Donald Trump chose to modulate his stance on abortion by declaring early on that each state should decide this matter for itself and then doubling down by vowing to veto a national abortion ban. Many longtime foes of abortion were disappointed, and some were outraged. Nevertheless, Trump paid no price, winning 81% of the white evangelical vote—virtually unchanged from four years ago.

Harris’ defeat

The Harris campaign was always running uphill. She served as vice president to a president whose approval rating plunged in the middle of his first year in office and never recovered. The public’s judgment of his performance on two core issues—inflation and immigration—was harshly negative, and Harris inherited this disapproval when Joe Biden abandoned his quest for a second term.

The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president’s tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters. She did the best she could in the circumstances by quickly unifying the party and building on Biden’s campaign apparatus rather than starting from scratch, but she never entirely overcame the difficulties stemming from Biden’s timetable.

Harris’ theory of the case was flawed. Looking at examples from the 2022 elections, she assumed that putting reproductive rights at the center of her agenda would mobilize an army of angry women and move them to the polls in record numbers. This did not happen. Women’s share of the total vote rose only marginally from its level in 2020, and Harris’ share of the women who voted did not increase from Biden’s 2020 levels. It is hard to judge how much this emphasis on abortion contributed to Harris’ poor showing among men—just 43%, down from Biden’s 48% in 2020—but it did nothing to convince them that a Harris administration would be sensitive to their concerns.

Her closing argument—that Donald Trump posed a clear and present danger to democracy—fared little better. This happened in part because many Republicans and Independents saw Harris and the Democrats as the real threats to democracy, and also because the charge offered no new information that would sway voters whose minds weren’t made up. Donald Trump may be the best-known candidate in modern American history, making it difficult to change anyone’s view of him.

Harris’ tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden’s unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters. Similarly, by refusing to explain why she had abandoned the progressive positions on crime, immigration, health care, and climate change, she blurred the public’s perception of her and opened the door to the Trump campaign’s charge that she was a closet radical. Thinking back to the successful campaign of Bill Clinton in 1992, some Democrats were hoping Harris would have a “Sister Souljah” moment in which she broke with some party orthodoxy in order to show her independence, but this did not happen.

Second, Harris’ decision to avoid media interviews during the first half of her campaign created the impression that she was dependent on scripted remarks and afraid to think on her feet. Answering tough questions can enhance a candidate’s reputation for competence and character, a potential upside to which Harris and her campaign seemed oblivious for much too long.

Conclusion

Democrats knew that the election would be close, but the scope of their defeat will likely trigger recriminations first and then an extended period of soul-searching. As was the case after Michael Dukakis’ defeat in 1988, the party will be forced to engage in a debate about the causes of its defeat, and what is sure to be a long and lively primary campaign will determine the path forward.

Meanwhile, President Trump will be challenged to honor the sweeping promises he made during his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can impose massive tariffs without raising costs for average families and triggering another round of inflation. Also uncertain is whether he can quell conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as quickly as he claims while reducing America’s global commitments. And it is possible that trying to deport millions of immigrants present in the U.S. could blow up in his face by creating civil strife and a backlash among Latino voters who have rallied to this cause. If he fails to meet the hopes that he has aroused, especially in the new supporters who provided his majority, he and his party may pay a price in 2026 and beyond.",Why Donald Trump won and Kamala Harris lost: An early analysis of the results  Brookings Institution,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/
"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Canvassing for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania - The New Yorker,"As several friends and I knocked on the front doors of registered Democrats’ homes around Allentown, Pennsylvania, the weekend before the election, and in Northeast Philadelphia on Election Day, there were moments that felt emblematic. The white couple whose toddler, wearing a rainbow “Girl Power” T-shirt, blew kisses to us from her doorway before the family headed out to vote for Kamala Harris. The middle-aged Latino man who turned away from the Eagles game on his TV to inform us that he was looking forward to having a female President, because “men can’t get anything done.” The woman of Central American descent who said that she’d never felt like an outsider until Donald Trump was elected in 2016, at which point people began making pointed comments, in her presence, about immigrants. Or the tall, silver-haired white man in his eighties who told me he’d never voted before the 2020 election, when he took a day off work to do so. “Not to get Biden in,” he clarified. “To get Trump out. I don’t know how anyone can support him,” he added, glancing up his quiet street.

That conversation took place in Emmaus, the first area I visited south of Allentown, a municipality that includes blocks of modest, carefully tended homes tucked against a hillside ablaze with fall colors. An actual blaze was also taking place nearby—the East Coast is in the grip of a drought—producing a strange, amorphous cloud shape that hung over the region that Sunday. There were signs of economic distress in Emmaus (one apartment I visited had an eviction sign pasted to its door) but also an abundance of garden statuary, Halloween decorations, fall wreaths, and, above all, welcome signs—on doors, doormats, banners, placards, and wire structures. “Welcome Fall!” “Welcome to our home.” “Welcome, family and friends.” I’ve never read the word “Welcome” as many times as I did during my three days of canvassing in Pennsylvania.

I went to Allentown four years ago, too, on Election Day in 2020. I recall at that time there was more in-your-face signage for both parties, sometimes duelling across the attached porches of pairs of homes. This year, the political signifying felt lower-key, as if the majority of voters had agreed to tone it down. You might go a whole block without seeing any signs of political affiliation, except in the form of canvassers like us—and we were many. Outreach by Democrats was intense, well organized, and hopeful. Busloads of canvassers arrived from other states on all three days that I was in Pennsylvania, reminding people to vote for Harris-Walz. We saw a group of teen-age boys hanging door tags in Philadelphia on Election Day, and, for a while, we joined up with another canvasser, a local man in a yellow reflective vest, whose list overlapped with ours. At no point did we encounter Republican canvassers—a fact that felt significant, and buoyed us.

On Election Day, the sun bore down mercilessly on parched miniature lawns in Northeast Philadelphia; the occasional oak or maple trees were vastly outnumbered by elaborate stumps and depressions where trees had once stood. It was a freakish seventy degrees outside. The blocks of identical small freestanding homes, many with aluminum awnings shading their windows, reminded me viscerally of the Chicago neighborhood where my grandfather, a policeman and a lifelong Democrat, lived in his retirement. Here we encountered voters with Slavic surnames who had “We Stand with Ukraine” signs outside their houses, and an elderly Albanian couple who spoke no English and whose family members, two registered Democrats, were not at home.

At one point, a man who appeared to be Southeast Asian informed us that neither he nor his wife, the Democrat we were seeking (but never actually saw), planned to vote. “We will not be voting,” he repeated firmly, before shutting the door. It was an odd moment, but one that has returned to me since I heard the news that Pennsylvania had gone to Trump. That encounter, along with others that felt like outliers in the moment, keep floating back. We met a white man who looked to be in his late sixties. His wife, a registered Democrat, was not at home, but he seemed open to conversation. He was a lifelong Republican, he told us. The price of gas was intolerable. The Democrats’ claims that the economy was improving were “bullshit.” Smiling, he told the two of us, both women, “I would never vote for a Black, and I would never vote for a woman.” We thanked him for his time, shook our heads, and moved on.

Directly across the street, in a house not more than eight feet wide, we encountered our only undecided Democrat: a woman in her early thirties who said that she’d spent ten years in the military. Like her neighbor, she was friendly and game for discussion, and joined us outdoors in a hooded pink bathrobe while her dog barked furiously from behind her front window. She loathed Trump, she said, but was deeply unhappy with the process that had led to Harris’s presence on the ballot. She called the pressure on Biden to leave the race “elder abuse,” and had planned to vote for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., until he dropped out. We argued for Harris from every angle, but she appeared unconvinced. She hated the system, she said. Hated her choices. Hated the atmosphere of isolation that she felt right here in her own neighborhood. We were startled to hear this; several homes we’d visited on her block had stickers on their windows indicating that veterans lived there. The houses were cheek by jowl; the polling place was a church a few doors down. There was no traffic, and hardly any noise at all apart from barking dogs. With its phalanx of silent welcomes imploring us from every side, her street looked like the very picture of American community. And yet, she told us, she didn’t know a single one of her neighbors. ♦",Canvassing for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania  The New Yorker,The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/dispatches/canvassing-for-kamala-harris-in-pennsylvania

Today, the Muhlenberg College Democrats hosted a major political rally for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, in the Life Sports Center. The historic event was made possible in part by the Lehigh Valley’s status as “the swingiest area in the swingiest state in the whole nation,” as Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro put it in his remarks.

For Muhlenberg students in the College Democrats, it was the culmination of a semester spent volunteering for the campaign.

“When I received confirmation that the campaign had accepted our invitation I was so beyond thrilled,” said Skylyn Ellison ’27, a political science major and president of the College Democrats, before the event. “This is such an important event at such an important moment in the campaign and I am so beyond excited that the Muhlenberg community will get to be a part of it.”

“This is such an important event at such an important moment in the campaign and I am so beyond excited that the Muhlenberg community [got] to be a part of it.”

—Skylyn Ellison ’27, president of the College Democrats

“The moment we realized that it’s actually happening, I think we were both extremely excited but also in a complete [state] of shock and disbelief,” said Kabir Burman ’27, a political science and media & communication double major and vice president of the College Democrats, before the event. “The fact that [Harris is] actually coming here the day before the election is what really stands out, and we know that that’s going to really excite campus, so we’re really grateful for that.”

Ellison and Burman worked with the campaign ahead of the event, putting in long hours onsite — Ellison was at the Life Sports Center until 2 a.m. Monday — as well as day-of. They were among the students and community members seated on the stage behind Harris during her speech.

The event also presented opportunities for students beyond the political science department. Five students from the staff of The Muhlenberg Weekly had press credentials to the event and were there interviewing attendees, taking photographs and posting to social media.

“It’s actually so unreal to be doing this and to have this opportunity. I’ve been telling my friends, ‘I got a press pass to cover this,’ and they’ve been so shocked, and it’s not even real to me yet,” Keanna Peña ’25, an English & creative writing major and the editor in chief of The Muhlenberg Weekly, said before the event. “It’s giving me a taste of breaking news; something has to be in tonight.

In addition to Shapiro, U.S. Representative Susan Wild and Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk were among the speakers at the event. Puerto Rican salsa artist Frankie Negrón performed, and Puerto Rican rapper Fat Joe delivered remarks ahead of Harris’ speech.

According to the campaign, the event drew more than 4,000 attendees, including 2,500 in Memorial Hall and 1,700 in the Field House. Another 2,000 potential attendees were turned away due to capacity limits.

Harris delivered a speech that lasted about 25 minutes. Some of the loudest applause came when she addressed the young people — including the Muhlenberg students — in the crowd.

“Every day, I see the promise of America in the young leaders who are voting for the first time.”

“Every day, I see the promise of America in the young leaders who are voting for the first time,” she said, pausing to let the cheers subside. “I love Gen Z, and here’s one of the reasons why. Here’s one of the things about y’all: You are rightly impatient for change.”

Harris ended the speech by reminding attendees to cast their votes the following day, on Election Day.

"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Kamala Harris and the Glass Cliff - Council on Foreign Relations,"There is much to understand about the 2024 U.S. presidential election and the resounding defeat that American voters handed to Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. A thorough-going assessment is needed, backed by more data—including better data than pollsters have provided yet. Still, seventy-two hours after the vote and three and a half months since Vice President Harris stepped into the race following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal under pressure from Democratic leaders and donors, several things are clear.

Democratic strategist James Carville’s quip about the 1992 election, “It’s the economy, stupid,” remained as valid as ever. Forty-five percent of voters said their financial situation was worse than four years ago and did not feel that the Democratic party had adequately responded to those concerns. While Harris offered proposals to address price-gouging by grocery stores, an acute shortage of affordable housing, and the cost of raising children, voters were unpersuaded given the toll that high inflation had already taken on their household budgets. In a Rose Garden speech after the election, President Biden acknowledged that much of the job-creating legislation he sponsored to build infrastructure, semiconductor factories, and green energy, would take years to take full effect.

Underlying this is a much bigger concern for the Democratic party: although Harris laid out more specific economic remedies than Trump, a class divide appears to be leading many Americans to believe that the party does not listen to them, respect them, or care about their priorities. Democrats will want to deeply explore and analyze this issue, including how significantly those views are shaped by exposure to inadequate or biased information sources. But it seems clear that to win future elections, the party will need to address the fact that a majority of non-college graduates have moved away from the Democratic party in decisive numbers: 56 percent of voters without a college degree voted for Trump, according to Edison Research exit polls. White voters without college degrees voted for Trump in even higher numbers (66 percent). Latino voters, particularly men, also moved away from the Democratic party in this election.

The results of exit polls, which will be refined in later analysis, also revealed that a majority of all women voters (53 percent) voted for Harris, but in smaller numbers than for Biden in 2020 (57 percent) and fewer than needed to offset the larger numbers of men (55 percent) who voted for Trump. A pivotal role was once again played by white women, the largest single bloc of voters, 53 percent of whom voted for Trump, replicating their preference for him in the two previous elections. This fall-off in the women’s vote is puzzling as it occurred despite agreement on the issue of abortion, a life-or-death issue which featured strongly in Harris’s campaign. Two-thirds of the American electorate agree with the Democratic party’s position and support abortion in all or most cases. Voters in seven states underlined this fact by enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions, to hedge against possible further federal action to restrict those rights, provision of abortion pills by mail, and punitive measures against those who travel or support travel for those needing abortions.

This brings us to one of the most troubling questions about the election, which is whether the United States is still not ready to elect a woman president. It is important to examine closely whether and to what degree voters rejected Harris’s historic candidacy because she is a woman or because she is a Black woman. Neither Edison Research nor the Associated Press, two of the largest election-day polling efforts, asked any version of that question. The responses would not in any event have revealed the role that hidden or unconscious bias may have played. However, two-thirds of voters who told the Edison pollsters that they considered “the ability to lead” to be the most important personal trait picked Trump, versus one-third who chose Harris for that reason. This might indicate a gendered perception of leadership, and if so, it would reflect previously documented preference for leaders who are men. The latest worldwide Gender Social Norms Index, based on the World Values Survey, for example, has documented a prevalent and persistent bias against women political leaders and women’s political equality. This 2023 survey found that in the United States, women are even more biased against women leaders and women’s equality than men (37.78 compared to 33.19 percent).

Other polls show that support for gender equality is decreasing, particularly among men. And it would not be surprising, given the nature of the campaign run by the Republican ticket, which featured a constant barrage of demeaning, sexist, and racist comments about Harris – including the vice president-elect calling her “trash” in his final rally – if the post-election analysis documents an upsurge in bias. The rallies featured T-shirt vendors doing a brisk trade in T-shirts, calling Harris a ho and a tramp, and the president-elect amplified social media posts about her that contained lewd and profane comments and depictions. Both men dismissed complaints about the slurs, characterizing them as “jokes.”

This question is vital for those of us interested in ensuring that women have a level playing field to compete for the top job, and all political positions, to participate fully in democratic governance. Unlike half of the world’s countries, the United States does not have either legislated mandatory quotas or voluntary party quotas for legislative seats, which ensures that women’s voices and perspectives contribute to the formation of policies and laws that pertain to women and men alike. But politicians and activists in both the Democratic and Republican parties have made concerted efforts to increase women candidacies for office—including E-PAC formed by Republican House Conference leader Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY), who has also noted that women should be part of the party leadership to open those gates to power.

A final consideration as efforts to understand this election’s outcome continue: Harris’s campaign, conducted over a short three months, deserves to be credited for skillful execution under extraordinary circumstances. Once tapped for the job, she had little time to lose to mount an eleventh-hour rescue mission for the Democrats. It was a classic case of a woman leader being thrust into a glass cliff” situation, a term first coined to address how most women came to be appointed CEO. Faced with a company/party/country in freefall, a highly qualified woman is tapped to rescue a situation that might well be unsalvageable. This was the fate of Carly Fiorina at Hewlett Packard, Teresa May in the United Kingdom, and Kamala Harris in 2024.

As of July 22, President Biden’s favorability rating was 41 percent, and his disapproval rating was 58 percent. Harris had played the dutiful vice-president, the first woman in that role, but failed to receive the kind of exposure and credit that might have established her with voters before this Hail Mary moment. Yet she plunged in with energy, coherent and temperate language, and a smiling demeanor as she relentlessly repeated her main message to a polarized country: “More unites us than divides us.” Despite being baited by Fox’s Bret Baier to condemn Trump voters, she passionately defended their freedom of choice as the hallmark of democracy. She refused to take on gendered attacks and firmly rejected any suggestion that voters should make choices based on gender, race, or any other identity. Harris secured the support of Democratic party delegates in forty-eight hours, raised over a billion dollars, organized an army of volunteers in a stunning ground game, and stumped tirelessly in venues packed with enthusiastic followers until the last hour of the campaign. Her policies, fashioned on the fly, had specificity and inclusivity beyond any proposal offered by her opponent. Most of all, Harris displayed civility, empathy, and a commitment to the rule of law that serves as a model for the days ahead, as all those who love this democracy can appreciate.",Kamala Harris and the Glass Cliff  Council on Foreign Relations,Council on Foreign Relations,https://www.cfr.org/blog/kamala-harris-and-glass-cliff

With just a day to go before Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has shifted its strategy, to end on a “fully positive” note. The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee spoke at four stops across battleground Michigan on Sunday without mentioning her Republican opponent Donald Trump by name, according to The Associated Press.

Harris has repeatedly called out Trump by name since entering the presidential race after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection in July. She called him “unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power” while speaking at The Ellipse last week. But on Sunday, she sought to contrast her optimism with Trump’s rhetoric without invoking his name.

Harris: Election outcome 'not what we fought for'

Nearly a month ago, Kamala Harris appeared on ABC's The View in what was expected to be a friendly interview aimed at pitching herself to Americans who wanted to know more about her. But the sit-down was quickly overshadowed by her response to a question on what she would have done differently from incumbent president, Joe Biden: ""Not a thing comes to mind."" Harris's answer - which became a Republican attack ad on loop - underscored the political headwinds that her jumpstart campaign failed to overcome in her decisive loss to Donald Trump on Tuesday. Publicly, she conceded the race late on Wednesday afternoon, telling supporters ""do not despair"". But soul-searching over where she went wrong and what else she could have done will likely take longer as Democrats begin finger-pointing and raising questions about the future of the party.

Harris campaign officials were silent in the early Wednesday hours while some aides expressed tearful shock over what they had expected to be a much closer race. ""Losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard,"" Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in an email to staff on Wednesday. ""This will take a long time to process."" As the sitting vice-president, Harris was unable to untether herself from an unpopular president and convince voters that she could offer the change they were seeking amid widespread economic anxiety.

Biden's baggage

After Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate performance, Harris was anointed to the top of the ticket, bypassing the scrutiny of a primary without a single vote being cast. She began her 100-day campaign promising a ""new generation of leadership"", rallying women around abortion rights and vowing to win back working-class voters by focusing on economic issues including rising costs and housing affordability. With just three months until election day, she generated a wave of initial momentum, which included a flurry of memes on social media, a star-studded endorsement list that included Taylor Swift and a record-setting donation windfall. But Harris couldn't shake the anti-Biden sentiment that permeated much of the electorate. The president's approval rating has consistently hovered in the low 40s throughout his four years in office, while some two-thirds of voters say they believe the US is on the wrong track.

Some allies have privately questioned whether Harris remained too loyal to Biden in her bid to replace him. But Jamal Simmons, the vice-president's former communication director, called it a ""trap"", arguing any distance would have only handed Republicans another attack line for being disloyal. ""You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,"" he said. Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail. But she then failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country, and how she would handle economic frustrations as well as widespread concerns over immigration.

US voters on one reason Trump won... and why Harris lost

About 3 in 10 voters said their family's financial situation was falling behind, an increase from about 2 in 10 four years ago, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 US voters conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Nine in 10 voters were very or somewhat concerned about the price of groceries. The same survey found that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020. And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on.

Struggle to build on Biden's network of support

The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters. But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was ""no great surprise"" that working class voters abandoned the party. ""First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,"" he said. ""And they're right."" While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women. In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory. While some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for Harris, it fell short of the 57% who backed Biden in 2020, according to exit poll data.

Making it about Trump backfired

Even before she was catapulted to the top of the ticket, Harris had sought to frame the race as a referendum on Trump, not Biden. The former California prosecutor leaned into her law enforcement record to prosecute the case against the former president. But her nascent campaign opted to ditch Biden's core argument that Trump posed an existential threat to democracy, prioritising a forward-looking ""joyful"" message about protecting personal freedoms and preserving the middle class. In the final stretch, however, Harris made a tactical decision to again highlight the dangers of a second Trump presidency, calling the president a ""fascist"" and campaigning with disaffected Republicans fed up with his rhetoric. After Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told the New York Times that Trump spoke approvingly about Adolf Hitler, Harris delivered remarks outside her official residence describing the president as ""unhinged and unstable"". ""Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump,"" veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday night. ""Voters already know everything there is about Trump – but they still wanted to know more about Harris’ plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration."" “It was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris’s own ideas,” he added. Ultimately, the winning coalition Harris needed to beat Trump never materialised, and voters' resounding rejection of Democrats showed that the party has a deeper problem than just an unpopular president.",Why Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump  BBC.com,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4l5j2v9do
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Where Harris’ campaign went wrong - CNN,"CNN —

It was supposed to be everything short of a free ad – a panel of women not containing their excitement to welcome Kamala Harris, ready to introduce her to their committed daytime audience of exactly the type of women the vice president’s campaign always hoped were going to be critical to her base.

It was a moment that encapsulated one of the biggest challenges facing her campaign – which, in the end, proved insurmountable.

“What, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?” co-host of ABC’s “The View” Sunny Hostin asked Harris, looking to give her a set for her to spike over the net.

“There is not a thing that comes to mind,” she said.

Even Harris realized she had a problem, trying to adjust a moment later by saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.

Aides didn’t wait until Harris was off the set to start trying to clean it up. A Democrat who had spoken with her told CNN at the time that she didn’t want to name her differences with President Joe Biden – including a higher capital gains tax rate, a bigger child tax credit and a tougher border policy – because she thought it would look disloyal to the man who had picked her as his running mate and then stepped aside for her.

The thud fell in a campaign already struggling with a listless October, which had replaced the late summer exuberance and a September debate that nearly every political observer other than Donald Trump acknowledged she crushed. As aides new to the Harris orbit exerted control, she struggled with preparation. She grew hesitant, losing some of the confidence and swagger that had defined the early weeks of her reintroduction to the country. Aides who had successfully pushed her out of her comfort zone earlier in the year felt like they were running into the kind of walls she used to put up.

CNN spoke with over a dozen senior Harris campaign aides both in the Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters and on the ground in the states, as well as multiple volunteers and local elected officials, over the course of the final weeks of the race.

A country crying out for change got a candidate who, at a crucial moment as more voters were tuning in, decided to soft-pedal the change she knew she represented.

In the scope of a Democratic ticket that pulled off the biggest turnaround in approval ratings and the fastest consolidation around a new candidate in the history of modern presidential politics, this may have seemed like a minor moment. But it reflected deeper problems: some, like with the staff around her, that she might have been able to adjust; and one, with Biden, that she could never shake, with internal polls showing overwhelming majorities of voters thought the country was on the wrong track.

By the time Harris got a clearer, sharper contrast answer out on the Biden question, the situation had congealed in ways she never got past – both among voters wavering in the center who wanted to hear her rebuff the president on his handling of the economy and voters on the left who wanted to hear her more forcefully disavow Biden’s support for Israel.

But perhaps the bigger problem with Biden, top Democrats fumed in the aftermath of that fateful debate in June and then again as they watched the results turn red on Tuesday, is that he should have never been anywhere near the 2024 race. If he had stepped aside after the midterms, as some aides urged him to, the Democratic Party process could have played out in a primary campaign. Candidates’ kinks could have been worked out – or not. Almost certainly whoever emerged as the nominee would have gone into the final weeks without so many Americans complaining they didn’t know enough, as they said about Harris. Biden could have taken on a role as steward and elder statesman, rather than a guy the Harris campaign never knew quite what do with.

Late surge of optimism crashes

If the election had been two weeks ago, senior aides to Harris were admitting in recent days, the vice president probably would have lost. But they went into Tuesday feeling like she had gotten herself to a likely squeaker victory. One-on-one conversations volunteers were having as they knocked on doors seemed to be clicking. For the first time in his nine years dominating American politics, Trump’s character seemed to be breaking through as an actual weight on people who wanted to vote for him.

Leading Democrats smiled just thinking about what it would mean to beat Trump with the first female president — a woman of color, a child of two immigrants, a prosecutor, and a candidate who talked about joy and offered up her smile against the scowl that had become his most common expression. Her candidacy sparked in them the unfamiliar feeling of hope.

That sentiment evaporated by 11 p.m. on Tuesday. But for many anxious Democrats, this is just the beginning. Going into Election Day, many top Democratic operatives across the campaign and in the states told CNN different versions of the same thought: If this didn’t work – with the massive campaign they’d put together, with millions of doors knocked by volunteers who flooded into battleground states, with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney and former President Bill Clinton united under the same tent stumping hard for her, with celebrities from Bad Bunny and Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing their cultural weight behind her – what will?

“I can’t imagine, I can’t even get my mind around what it would be like if Donald Trump won, because he is telling us such dark and sinister things that he’s going to do, and I believe him,” Sen. Cory Booker told CNN after a campaign stop late Monday afternoon in Bucks County, Pennsylvania – one of the key swing districts in the crucial battleground state.

The New Jersey Democrat said he had already warned his own staff about not giving up.

“We need to get up the next morning and forge forward,” Booker said. “I told them how much I don’t like hearing people say, ‘Oh, if so-and-so wins, I’m going to go to Canada. That’s just not our history. We’ve seen really bad outcomes out of bad historical events in our country, and we’re here because of the resiliency, the toughness, the strength of our country — and people even in the worst of times dug in and tried to do the best for our country.”

Simmering internal fights and a revealing pick in Walz

Harris’ team would have gladly taken more time to introduce the vice president to the country, or to put together an operation, which, after the ticket switch in July, woke up every morning at campaign headquarters and in the states feeling behind on planning.

But by the time the campaign pulled off its multi-state simultaneous rally across battleground states Monday evening – which ended with Lady Gaga singing her song “The Edge of Glory” and adding in, “I’m an American woman on the edge” on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art – a nervous feeling of maybe having made a movement happen was spreading among Harris aides and top supporters.

Those aides were a hodgepodge. Biden hadn’t just struggled as a candidate, but had failed to attract some top talent to his campaign because a generation of up-and-coming Democrats could never get excited about him. Harris tried to graft some of her own team onto them, even overlooking tensions between them from the early days of the Biden administration with campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and keeping her in charge.

But some of those who had been in Wilmington for a year before Harris became the candidate bucked at their new bosses. Alumni of Barack Obama – most prominently his 2008, campaign manager David Plouffe, but also many others who moved into state operations – tried to flex a sometimes dated but often more incisive sense of how to win voters.

Along the way, multiple aides told CNN how much they were grinding on one another. But the mission to beat Trump and the short timeline to try to get there helped paper over a lot of the infighting that might have exploded in a longer campaign. It instead just raged behind the scenes as aides like Stephanie Cutter moved to exert dominance over defining how and what Harris said what she said.

And those tensions manifested from almost the start of this short campaign, in the internal wrangling over who Harris should pick as her running mate. The case for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was strong, and not just because Harris’ brother-in-law Tony West was telling her they looked like the future of the Democratic Party together, and that the popular governor would make sure she won Pennsylvania. Right-wing media types weren’t the only ones who noticed how much Shapiro had made himself into an Obama clone, as much a Jewish guy from the Philadelphia suburbs could be: The Obama alumni suddenly rushing onto her campaign were pushing for Shapiro.

Harris liked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, though. She liked his line about Republicans being weird. She liked the way he came off as easy and unassuming. She liked the way they’d gotten along in their interview, including his very open stress that he would mess up in a debate with Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. And she liked the way Walz had been so deferential to however she would define the job for him.

In the end, Harris made a decision that simultaneously reflected her newfound confidence and her long-standing insecurity, solid with trusting her own instincts, fine with going against her family and against the Obama orbit, but also with no interest in having anyone who would possibly outshine her.

Then, as top aides kept Harris away from interviews and unscripted moments for weeks longer than many on the campaign thought made sense, Walz was necessarily kept in a box too, so that he didn’t come off more accessible than she was.

Tuesday morning, outside a canvas launch in northeast Philadelphia, Shapiro deflected a question about whether Pennsylvania — and the race — would have looked different had he been the choice.

“I think she made a great pick in Tim Walz,” he said.

Democrats try to make sense of gut punch

Biden, most Democrats were confident going into Tuesday, would have never even been in contention. The president watched the results come in from the White House, making a few calls to local winning candidates back in Delaware. Some who spoke with him as he made the decision to drop out in July briefly lingered on what might have been – maybe he could have won by keeping his numbers even in counties where he ended up outperforming Harris, or if he’d lost anyway, at least it wouldn’t have put the burden on a Black woman. He said nothing publicly.

Harris ran on positivity. She ran on inclusivity. She convinced a party full of insiders who had gone into the year ready to write her off for the 2028 Democratic nomination that they should go all in on her for 2024.

At the beginning of the night Tuesday, when victory seemed just hours away, the people who came to what was supposed to be Harris’ celebration were dancing. A Howard University graduate seemed about to walk into history in the heart of her old HBCU campus. At one point, the camera found the student body president in the crowd and she blushed as she saw herself projected on the big screen. Anticipation mounted and cheers went out with every state called for Harris.

Seconds after North Carolina was called for Trump, the audio was switched off the big screens and music blasted through the speakers to try to salvage the energy. Most kept staring silently at the numbers, trying to make sense of what had happened.

In state capitals with Democratic governors, break-glass plans that they had started to believe they would never need are getting yanked off the shelves – to protect access to abortion medications, but also to work up other protections from what they believe will be not just a stringent, but vindictive, administration. Early thoughts about who will be running and how in 2028 are starting to circulate.

That was not on the minds of the people who started streaming out of the Howard campus early Wednesday before campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond had even finished telling them that there was still counting to be done.

"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Harris urges voters to reject Trump’s efforts to sow division and fear - The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris stood before an overflowing crowd near the White House on Tuesday and promised Americans she would fight for them every day as she urged voters to reject Donald Trump’s efforts to sow division and fear, declaring, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

One week out from Election Day, the vice president tried to drive home the contrast with Trump by delivering her closing argument from the same spot on the grassy Ellipse where the Republican former president had fomented the Capitol insurrection in 2021, pledging that she would work to improve people’s lives while arguing that her Republican opponent is only in it for himself.

“I’ll be honest with you: I’m not perfect,” she said. “I make mistakes. But here’s what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me. I will always tell you the truth, even if it’s hard to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.”

Harris began her capstone speech by reminding voters of Trump’s role in the chaos of Jan. 6, 2021, when he spewed falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election that inspired a crowd to march to the Capitol and try unsuccessfully to halt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. She brought up his threats to use the military against his political rivals and his labeling of those who disagree with him as “the enemy from within.”

“Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” she said. Trump, she added, “has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other.”

What to know about Trump’s second term:

“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said, branding Trump a “petty tyrant” and “wannabe dictator.”

Harris continued: “But America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are.” She added, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

Harris sought to use her largest remaining stage before polls close to make a broader case for why voters should reject Trump and consider what she offers, while still introducing herself to voters clamoring for more information.

The White House gleaming behind her, Harris encouraged the crowd to visualize their divergent futures depending on who wins on Election Day.

“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” she said. “On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”

Harris went on to list key policy goals, including expanding Medicare coverage of home health care, boosting the supply of housing in the country and working to restore nationwide access to abortion.

Her speech drew a massive crowd to Washington, with supporters spilling out toward the Washington Monument on the National Mall. More critically, her campaign hopes the setting will help catch the attention of battleground state voters who remain on the fence about whom to vote for — or whether to vote at all.

Ahead of Harris’ remarks, her campaign showcased a line-up of ordinary Americans who spoke about their dream and priorities, rather than showcasing the star power that has been featured at some recent Harris events. They included Amanda Zurawski, a woman who nearly died from sepsis after being denied care under Texas’ strict abortion ban, Craig Sicknick, the brother of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, and a Pennsylvania husband and wife who previously vote for Trump but now back Harris.

Ruth Chiari, 78, of Charlottesville, Virginia, said she attended the rally with her husband to “support democracy.”

“I think everybody understands what’s on the ballot,” she said as she waited in line to enter the event. “We’re either going to have an autocrat or freedom.”

Kathleen Nicholas, 36, a government relations worker in Washington, remembered Jan. 6 and loved the contrast of Tuesday’s crowd and atmosphere with that day. “I like she chose this place for her closing,” she said. “Having something that is a direct contrast to that day is what we needed.”

With time running out and the race tight, Harris and Trump have both sought big moments to try to shift momentum their way.

AP AUDIO: Harris reaches for a big moment in her closing argument for ‘turning the page’ on Trump AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports Kamala Harris will give her campaign’s closing argument tonight from the same spot where Donald Trump rallied supporters before the Capitol riot.

The address came days after Harris traveled to Texas, a reliably Republican state, to appear with megastar Beyoncé and emphasize the consequences for women after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That, too, was a speech meant to register with voters far away in the battleground states.

The vice president’s latest address has been in the works for weeks. But aides hoped her message would land with more impact after Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York, where speakers hurled cruel and racist insults.

“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” Harris said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self.”

Also central to her message: positioning herself as a “new generation” of leader after Trump and even her current boss, President Joe Biden.

“It is time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,” she said. “It is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States.”

She acknowledged that “many of you are still getting to know who I am” after her surprise elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden dropped out of the race in July, and used her remarks to try to answer voters’ curiosity.

“I recognize this has not been a typical campaign,” Harris said, adding that she is “not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests.”

Ahead of Harris’ speech, Trump used remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday morning to accuse Harris of closing with a message that doesn’t address everyday Americans’ day-to-day struggles and kitchen-table concerns.

He said Harris keeps “talking about Hitler, and Nazis, because her record’s horrible,” a reference to Harris amplifying the warnings from his former chief of staff that Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi leader while in office.

Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “His closing argument to the American people is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it.”

Biden told reporters Tuesday that he would not attend Harris’ speech because the event is “for her,” but he sparked a firestorm ahead of Harris’ remarks. Reacting to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend, Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”

With Republicans amplifying his comments seemingly denigrating Trump supporters, Biden sought to clarify them in a post on X. “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”

My choice to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris this November wasn’t decided this summer. It was decided when I was 14, I stood in front of my parents’ TV and watched then-nominee for the Republican party Donald J. Trump laugh about how he regularly sexually assaulted women and got away with it because of who he was. That moment was what got me into politics, because I just couldn’t believe that half of voting America would back a man who was so boldly open about his criminal behavior.

America moved on from that leaked video, and Trump would go on to win the electoral vote in 2016. He would use his presidency to pack the Supreme Court with judges who overturned my right to my body; raise the national debt by 40 percent (more than in any other presidential term) because he wanted to lower taxes for the rich; deliberately spread misinformation about the COVID-19 crisis (a choice that would needlessly kill hundreds of thousands of Americans); and to top it off, he couldn’t handle losing in 2020 so he helped incite an insurrection against our nation that would leave 150 people injured and 2 dead.

Ironically, Trump uses the pro-police “Back the Blue” movement to shield his racism (he referred to COVID as “Chinese flu” and “kung flu,” he wanted to ban Muslim immigrants, and he was endorsed by the KKK in 2016, although his campaign rejected the endorsement, among other things). He was then convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 separate counts of committing fraud while he was president, making him a felon.

I could go on and on about why Trump is the single biggest threat to America and how that plays a role in how I am going to vote. But that would be an injustice against how great a candidate Vice President Kamala Harris is.

Harris comes from a middle-class biracial family, and she rose through the ranks of public office organically, without the benefit of a “small loan of a million dollars.” She went to Howard University and UC Hastings Law [now UC Law San Francisco], passed the notoriously difficult California state bar, became a prosecutor who not only put criminals away, but helped prevent repeat offending, and went on to become the first African-American, first Asian-American, and first woman to be elected San Francisco district attorney and attorney general of California. There she went after predatory for-profit colleges and banks, promoted criminal justice reform, and voiced opposition to the death penalty. As a US senator, Harris went viral for her grilling of Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court over laws governing women’s bodies but not men’s, and she supported Medicare for all, COVID relief, and anti-lynching bills.

The Trump campaign has tried to go after Vice President Harris for a supposed lack of a policy platform; that claim is demonstrably false. She has released a detailed policy plan designed to help average Americans, which includes policies like down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, raising the level of eligible deduction expenses for small businesses, expanding healthcare access to rural Americans, passing the bipartisan border-security bill that Trump killed, among many other policies.

Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room; in our 248 years as a nation, we have never elected a woman. Many voters will need to overcome years of social conditioning that have told them that women aren’t meant to lead because of their sex.

For me, the facts are clear; Trump is an overall poor leader who has stated that he will not be a dictator “other than on day one.” He has told Christians that if he is elected “in four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not gonna have to vote.” He has tried to distance himself from the radical Project 2025, authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, which outlines a government where the Department of Education would be eliminated, where leaders would pursue mass deportations, where FEMA would be defunded, and where the terms “reproductive rights and “gender equality” would be deleted from all federal laws, among many other extreme policies. Yet his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, has written the forward for a forthcoming book written by Kevin D. Roberts, who oversaw Project 2025. Trump supporters commonly point to lower costs during his presidency as a reason to vote for him, but his economic proposals for tariffs and tax cuts have been repeatedly called out by economists as potentially causing massive costs for Americans and further inflation.

With all those facts in mind, Vice President Harris stands out to me as the only choice, and this time I don’t have to vote for Biden just to vote against Trump: I get to vote for a woman whose policies will benefit the middle class instead of the rich, who believes in my right to my body, who believes in common sense gun laws, and who unequivocally will accept the results of the election for the good of the people, something Trump has refused to say he will do.

BBC

Vice-President Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party's nominee for president relatively late in the 2024 contest - having replaced Joe Biden - and she then selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like. This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living. Here are her key policy pledges. Who is Kamala Harris?

Who is Tim Walz?

Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues

Economy

As vice-president, Ms Harris worked with President Biden to pass major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets. In her convention acceptance speech, the vice-president promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. She added that her plans would create ""an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"". In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that one of her highest priorities was ""to support and strengthen the middle class"", a theme she has repeated on the campaign trail. US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?

Taxes

In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes. She co-sponsored a bill with former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also backed, to increase the rate to 28%. During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would ""pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans"". This refers to the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 (£4,630) tax cut. A campaign official also told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal to not raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).

Abortion

Ms Harris has long supported abortion rights. She was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as a matter of personal freedom. She has made abortion central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would safeguard reproductive rights nationwide. “When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia. She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump.

Immigration

Ms Harris's position on the border has become more moderate over time. On the campaign trail, she has reiterated her continued support for the cross-party border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction. It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans in February 2024 at Trump's urging. It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants. The vice-president says she would revive the bill and sign it into law. She has also said there ""should be consequences"" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she previously supported a more lenient approach. As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months. She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - to fund regional investments designed to encourage residents to remain in their home countries.

Nato and Ukraine aid

Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and those affecting the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since being elected to the US Senate. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in February 2024, where she spoke in support of western security alliance Nato and denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, and represented the US at Kyiv's “peace conference” in Switzerland in June 2024. In her speech at the Democratic convention, she said she warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Russian aggression five days before the invasion, and had ""helped mobilise a global response"" after the war began. The vice-president has also pledged, if elected, to reject isolationism and ensure that ""America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century"".

Israel-Gaza War

Ms Harris has been a long-time advocate for a two-state solution in the region, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure ""that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination"". As vice-president, she was one of the first people in the Biden administration to call for an ""immediate ceasefire"", raise concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charge Israel with ending the conflict. She raised these issues in what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. However, she has not supported the arms embargo on Israel which some on the US left want. At the party convention, she said she would ""always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself"". She reiterated her support for the country during the debate with Trump, saying ""I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people"". In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach.

Healthcare

Earlier in her career, Ms Harris supported expanding publicly-funded healthcare programmes that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor. This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive policy that would make all healthcare publicly funded. She later softened her support for this. Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House. During her vice-presidency, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue. Details remain thin, but when she was the California attorney general, Ms Harris regularly used anti-trust laws to put pressure on insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs.

Crime

Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, and then serving as California's attorney general. She was criticised by the progressive left for increasing conviction rates - particularly of violent criminals - and was at times labelled ""a cop"" - though the right has also accused her of being soft on crime. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. She mentioned Mr Trump's conviction - and that he had been found liable for committing sexual abuse - in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech.

Gun laws

Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career. While California's attorney general, she successfully defended the state's gun laws when they faced legal challenges. As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Earlier this year, she announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are designed to deny firearms to those who may harm themselves and others. She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programmes. Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks. During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners.

"Wed, 23 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Takeaways from Kamala Harris’ CNN town hall - CNN,"CNN —

Over and over, Vice President Kamala Harris argued at a CNN town hall Wednesday night that Republican rival Donald Trump is “unstable” and “unfit to serve.”

The Democratic nominee’s message in the closing weeks 2024 presidential race is squarely focused on warning Americans – particularly undecided independents and moderate Republicans – that Trump poses a threat to the nation’s core principles.

She pointed repeatedly to former senior military figures in Trump’s administration who have called him a fascist and claimed the former president spoke glowingly of the loyalty of Hitler’s Nazi generals. She also raised concern over his comments about turning the military against “enemies within.”

If Trump wins, Harris said, “He’s going to sit there, unstable and unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, creating an enemies list.”

Harris was as focused on putting the former Trump aides and military leaders’ comments in front of the Pennsylvania town hall crowd, and voters watching at home, as she was on detailing her own policy agenda.

Here are six takeaways from Harris’ CNN town hall:

Yes, Harris thinks Trump is a fascist

Harris was asked Wednesday night if she considers Trump a fascist.

“Yes, I do,” she said. But, she added, she doesn’t want voters to take her word for it.

Harris pointed to senior military leaders who served under Trump and have said the former president is a fascist – including the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, and Trump’s former White House chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly.

“I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted,” Harris said.

The vice president’s condemnation of Trump as a threat to the United States’ founding principles is a window into how she is trying to win over the small number of undecided voters — including educated, suburban moderate Republicans and independents — in the race’s closing weeks. She is casting Trump as a threat to democracy, rather than focusing on her policy differences with the former president.

Harris said more than 400 members of Republican presidential administrations have endorsed her – and she named former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who has campaigned with her, and former Vice President Dick Cheney, specifically.

She said those Republicans’ support for her campaign is motivated by “a legitimate fear, based on Donald Trump’s words and actions, that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

Harris distances herself from Biden, promises ‘a new generation of leadership’

Harris has faced repeated questions on the trail over how – and to what degree – she would break from Biden on policy. Mostly, she has brushed them off.

In one particularly awkward exchange, she told the hosts of ABC’s “The View,” who asked what she would’ve done differently from the president, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”

On Wednesday night, though, Harris seemed more comfortable with the proposition and argued that, if she was elected, change would follow.

“My administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration,” Harris said. “I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues and believe that we have to actually take new approaches.”

After ticking off a few major policy plans, like having Medicare cover home health care for the elderly, Harris returned to what she described as “a new approach.”

“I bring a whole set of different experiences to this job,” she said.

Pressed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper about why she hasn’t, during her time as vice president, been more assertive on those points, Harris was short on details – later on she would present a Middle East policy identical to Biden’s – but hammered home the talking point.

“There was a lot that was done (during the Biden administration), but there’s more to do,” Harris said. “I’m pointing out things that need to be done, that haven’t been done.”

Border security and migration are a tricky area for the vice president

By both Cooper and audience members, the vice president was pressed on border security.

She was asked on the record number of illegal border crossings that occurred during the Biden administration in spite of multiple executive orders. That flow had only begun to shrink after a major executive action earlier this year, Cooper noted, and asked why Biden and Harris hadn’t done something sooner.

Harris argued that the Biden administration, and she personally, believed that executive actions were just short-term solutions and that a long-term fix could only happen through a bipartisan agreement in Congress. She stressed the need for a large bipartisan bill on border security.

“Let’s just fix the problem” Harris said multiple times.

She contrasted that with Trump’s record on border security where she mocked him for failing to fulfill his promise to build a border wall across the United States’ southern border and make Mexico pay for it.

“I think of what he did and how he did it didn’t make much sense because he didn’t do much of anything,” she said.

Harris also pushed back on the idea that she was soft on border security and immigration, saying “people have to earn it” in gaining American citizenship and that she wanted “to strengthen our border.”

Harris wants Sinwar’s death to be a moment to end the Israel-Hamas war

One of Harris’ biggest challenges has been attempting to find a middle ground between staunchly supporting Israel’s war in Gaza in the wake of the October 7, 2023, attack and calling for the return of hostages held by Hamas, while seeking a ceasefire to end the humanitarian crisis and tens of thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths in the territory.

Democrats have sought to maintain support among voters who oppose the US’ continued military aid to Israel. One undecided voter in the audience asked Harris what she would do to “ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by US tax dollars.”

Harris said it was “unconscionable” how many innocent Palestinians have died, but that she hoped the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar – who helped plan the October 7 attack and was killed by Israel earlier this month – would create an opportunity to end the conflict.

“With Sinwar’s death, I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people and work toward a two-state solution, where Israel and the Palestinians – in equal measure – have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self determination and the safety they that they so rightly deserve,” Harris said.

Cooper followed up by asking what Harris would say to people who are considering voting for a third-party candidate or staying home over the administration’s approach to the conflict in Gaza. Harris said that she understood that anyone who has seen what has happened in Gaza or lost family there would have strong feelings, but she said she believed those same voters care about their president’s approach to other issues, including the cost of groceries and reproductive rights.

The next question came from a voter asking how Harris would handle antisemitism. The vice president touted her work cracking down on hate crimes and called for new laws to deter future attacks. She also referenced Kelly’s comments regarding Trump and Hitler.

Cooper asked Harris if she thought Trump was antisemitic.

“I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well being and security of America,” she said.

Asked if she would be more pro-Israel than Trump, Harris criticized Trump’s foreign policy more broadly, including his affinity for authoritarian figures, reports that he sent Covid-19 tests to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his handling of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and, again, his alleged comments on Hitler.

Harris speaks Republicans’ language as she courts anti-Trump GOP vote

Harris’ campaign has spent the last few weeks working feverishly to court Trump-skeptical Republicans and right-leaning independents. On Wednesday night, the vice president reprised that appeal – both in what she said and how she said it.

She repeatedly name-dropped Liz Cheney, the former House member who broke from her party over Trump and lost her GOP leadership position and a primary for her sins – and has been at the center of Harris’ efforts to win over wobbly Republicans.

“I traveled this state and others with Liz Cheney,” Harris said early on, adding, “She has endorsed me.”

And not only her, she reminded the audience.

“Dick Cheney is voting for me. Over 400 members of previous members of” Republican administrations “have endorsed my candidacy,” Harris said, “and the reason why – among them is a legitimate fear based on Donald Trump’s words and actions, that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

A little while later, when discussing abortion rights, Harris again mentioned Liz Cheney, an “unapologetically pro-life” politician who, as the vice president put it, “doesn’t agree with what’s been happening” in states that banned abortion.

Harris also made a point of her desire to work with the private sector to solve public problems like the housing crisis.

“We need a new approach that includes working with the private sector. I say that as a devoted public servant,” Harris said, before assimilating traditionally moderate Republican rhetoric to describe her plan, which includes “working with the private sector to cut through the red tape, working with home builders, working with developers to create tax incentives so that we can create more housing supply and bring down the price.”

Unity is a bipartisan talking point, of course, but Harris repeatedly argued that “common sense” solutions were within grasp.

“The American people deserve to have a president who is grounded in what is common sense, what is practical and what is in the best interest of the people, not themselves,” Harris said, jabbing at Trump but hardly embracing anything like an ideologically liberal agenda.

Flip-flopping on issues

Another voter question challenged Harris on her shift to the middle during her three-month presidential campaign. Since becoming the nominee, the vice president has changed her stance on key issues, including backing away from her past support for redirecting police department funds to social services and banning fracking.

Harris said she does not want to ban fracking and hasn’t moved to do so as vice president, while reiterating that her “values” when it comes to addressing climate change haven’t changed. And when directly asked by Cooper if she thinks fracking is bad for the environment, Harris dodged the question.

“I think that we have proven that we can invest in a clean energy economy, we can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, we can work on sustaining what we need to do to protect this beautiful earth of ours and not ban fracking,” she said.

On her stance on law and order, Harris said there has been a “whole lot of misinformation” and emphasized that she’s spent most of her career as a prosecutor.

Harris then addressed her changed policy stances more broadly by defending what she described as her willingness to embrace good ideas, build consensus and not “stand on pride.”

“I believe in fixing problems. I love fixing problems,” Harris said. “And so I pledge to you to be a president who not only works for all Americans, but works on getting stuff done, and that means compromise.”

Cooper followed up to ask Harris about her shift in support for Medicare for All (Harris co-sponsored the single payer health care legislation when she was in the Senate but proposed a more moderate plan during her 2020 presidential campaign) and her past support for decriminalizing border crossings.

“I never intended, nor will I ever allow, America to have a border that is not secure,” Harris said, adding that there must be consequences for entering the country illegally.

"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost - The Guardian,"It has been an extraordinary week for US politics – and a very depressing couple of days for those such as me who spent hours on the phone to people, trying to persuade them to vote for Kamala Harris and not Donald Trump. This is what voters told me time and again, and why so many did vote for Trump.

The first type of voter I encountered as a volunteer on the Harris phone bank was the one focused purely on the economy. It is hard for people on the European side of the Atlantic to grasp that soaring growth rates and low unemployment in the US would not be seen positively in the eyes of an American voter. But it was clear in my conversations that the Trump campaign was extremely effective at countering that story. Wages may well be rising at all levels, but everyday inflation was more discernible to voters.

Very often, I spoke to small business owners who would talk about the price of gas or bread, rendering any attempted explanation of global pressures responsible for that ineffective at best, and at worst condescending. Often, they would also tell me that everyone they knew was doing badly, even if they were just fine themselves. Was poor messaging to blame? That didn’t seem obvious. Democrats tried to tell the story of average wages being higher and unemployment being at an historic low, but people just seemed to believe Trump more often than they believed Harris and Tim Walz. There was no easy way to counter that, especially in a campaign lasting barely 100 days.

The next group was extremely focused on Harris as a candidate. She was as baggage-free as a vice-president could have been, and many voters spoke of how much they admired her. But there were too many others. Multiple times, I was told that Harris was a “communist”, “clueless” and that she had “thrown black men in jail for carrying one blunt”. One Latin American voter told me at length that she had “seen it all before in South America”.

Harris’s perceived failures on border security did come up too, but mainly the criticisms came straight from the mouth of the Trump campaign. Some spoke of Harris’s tough stance on crime as the district attorney of San Francisco. Others, very often of Latino origin, would tell me that she was soft on law and order. Quite remarkably, the Trump campaign successfully branded Harris as both a communist – lax on law and order – and simultaneously too tough on crime. To many, she was both an ineffective vice-president and one who had her hands all over the Biden administration. Voters held these facts in their heads at once – and would not be persuaded otherwise.

I started calling voters five weeks ago and especially then, many voters said they didn’t know who Harris was or what she stood for. It is said that an open primary process would have given Harris the chance to separate herself from Biden, but not a single person I spoke to suggested that they would have preferred a different candidate.

But gender did play a role. Time and again, voters, very often women themselves, told me that they just didn’t think that “America is ready for a female president”. People said they couldn’t “see her in the chair” and asked if I “really thought a woman could run the country”. One person memorably told me that she couldn’t vote for Harris because “you don’t see women building skyscrapers”. Sometimes, these people would be persuaded, but more often than not it was a red line. Many conversations would start with positive discussions on policy and then end on Harris and her gender. That is an extraordinary and uncomfortable truth.

You should know what I didn’t hear during the hours speaking to US voters. I can only think of one occasion when someone mentioned stricter taxes on billionaires or any similar policies. The atrocities being committed by Israel in Gaza only came up six times in more than 1,000 calls. The idea that Harris was not leftwing enough seems false: the majority of the country just voted for the complete opposite.

After all those conversations, I think the main reason that Harris and Walz lost this campaign is simple: Trump. Ultimately, he was simply too much of a pull again. Despite the gaffes, despite his views on women, despite his distaste for democracy and despite an insurrection, voters just didn’t care.

For reasons that I’m sure will be studied for decades, when he speaks, people listen. When he speaks, people believe him. After all those calls, I can be shocked at this result, but hardly surprised.",I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump.

While she will not serve as the 47th president of the United States, Harris’ campaign has left an indelible mark on the nation and inspired millions.

“We remain deeply proud of Vice President Harris and all she has accomplished,” said Chancellor & Dean David Faigman. “Her historic campaign has shown how a strong legal education can empower individuals to pursue their most ambitious goals.”

Harris’ achievements are unprecedented. After earning her law degree from UC Law SF, she made history as the first woman elected district attorney of San Francisco and later as California’s first woman attorney general. In 2016, she shattered yet another glass ceiling as the first South Asian American elected to the U.S. Senate, and in 2020, she became the first woman to hold the office of vice president.

In remarks on Nov. 6, Harris spoke of the transformative value of perseverance: “Don’t ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. And don’t you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it’s never been done before.”

Harris spoke from the campus of Howard University, where she earned her undergraduate degree.

“Her journey will continue to serve as a powerful example for UC Law San Francisco students and alumni, inspiring us to envision new possibilities for legal education and how our community can transform society,” Faigman said.",Kamala Harris ’89 Concludes Historic Presidential Bid  UC Law San Francisco,UC Law San Francisco,https://www.uclawsf.edu/2024/11/06/kamala-harris-ends-presidential-bid/

Former first lady Michelle Obama hitting the campaign trail for Vice President Kamala Harris could hugely help the Democratic nominee’s campaign for the White House, experts told Newsweek. On Saturday, she will appear with Harris at a get-out-the-vote event in Michigan, according to a senior Harris campaign official. Her husband, former President Barack Obama, has been campaigning in swing states and is set to appear alongside Harris at a Thursday event in Georgia. Further details about the events have not been disclosed.

Saturday’s event will be the former first lady’s first time on the campaign trail to support Harris and will coincide with the first day of early voting in Michigan. Michelle Obama will also headline an Atlanta rally on October 29 hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement group that she founded in 2018 “to change the culture around voting.”

"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,How did Kamala Harris’s campaign rack up a debt after record fundraising? - Al Jazeera English,"The $20m spent on celebrity concerts draws scrutiny amid reports of a matching debt despite $1bn in earnings.

It was a record-breaking fundraising campaign: Vice President Kamala Harris raised more than $1bn in less than four months, during which she strove to win the US presidency, after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in July.

Now, as the dust settles on her failed bid, following her November 5 defeat to Donald Trump, a storm threatens to kick off over those very finances, after a Democratic National Convention (DNC) official declared that the Harris campaign was $20m in debt.

According to Open Secrets, the transparency nonprofit, the Harris war chest of more than $1bn dramatically dwarfed the approximately $382m that the Trump team pulled in during the same timeframe.

So how did the Kamala Harris campaign go from an overflowing treasury to debt?

Fast rise, steep fall

Soon after Biden pulled out of the presidential contest following a disastrous debate against Trump, the Democratic Party consolidated around Harris and her candidacy.

Quick off the blocks, her campaign raised $200m — 20 percent of the total $1bn drawn for her campaign — within the first week.

The money kept flowing in, but was also being spent.

On October 16, when the Harris campaign last filed a pre-election statement with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it had in excess of $180,000 left in the kitty.

But earlier this week, Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, told NewsNation, a cable news network, that the Harris campaign was now $20m in debt.

What did the Harris campaign spend money on?

The lion’s share of the campaign’s spend was on advertisements — roughly $654m, according to data from Adimpact, a company that provides advertising intelligence and data solutions.

But FEC filings show that the campaign also spent $20m — an amount almost identical to its reported debt — on concerts and celebrity appearances in the final days before the election.

A cadre of celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Megan thee Stallion and Lady Gaga performed at rallies in battleground states on the eve of Election Day. That may not have been the wisest investment, say some experts.

“Celebrity endorsements are highly overrated. Just because you like someone’s music doesn’t mean that that person has political clout with you,” Louis Perron, political strategist and author of Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections, told Al Jazeera. “On top of that, young voters are notoriously unreliable to turn out and vote.”

And “if it were a payment for the endorsement per se, it would of course further devalue the endorsement”.

FEC filings suggest that the campaign paid $1m to Oprah Winfrey’s production company.

Oprah has denied that she received any money. “Not true. I was paid nothing, ever,” the talk show star told TMZ.

According to a spokesperson for Harpo Productions, Oprah’s company, “the campaign paid for the production costs of ‘Unite for America,’ a livestreaming event that took place Sept. 19 outside Detroit, Mich.”

“Oprah Winfrey was at no point during the campaign paid a personal fee, nor did she receive a fee from Harpo,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Still, according to the DNC’s Li, that is obfuscation. “[Oprah] may not have gotten pay, personally as a person, but it paid her company. I think this is a matter of semantics. She got paid,” she told NewsNation.

Oprah interviewed Harris at a town hall event in September and appeared at her last campaign rally in Philadelphia a day before Election Day.

Village Marketing Agency, which reportedly received $3.9m for its services, was among the companies that secured a substantial payout. The firm’s primary task was to mobilise thousands of social media influencers in support of Harris, aiming to increase her appeal among younger voters.

How was the Trump campaign spend?

Although the Trump campaign raised $382m in the period that Harris raised more than $1bn, outside groups like Super PACs (political action committees) contributed roughly $711m, according to data from Open Secrets in an October 26 report. Outside groups similarly contributed more than $600m to Harris — including that, her war chest amounted to more than $1.6bn.

The America PAC, a Super PAC created by Elon Musk, an avid supporter of Trump, contributed $130m.

It focused on voter outreach and mobilisation efforts, including door-to-door canvassing. These activities are traditionally managed by the campaign itself and the political party, but the Super PAC was a key driving force behind increasing voter turnout for Trump.

Why did campaign fundraising go through the roof?

The 2024 US presidential campaign was not the costliest general election in the nation’s history. According to Open Secrets, the 2020 US presidential race between Joe Biden and Trump saw $7.7bn spent.

This year’s election saw a total spend of $5.5bn.

Still, these massive sums — more than the gross domestic products (GDPs) of many small nations — in campaign spending are driven by several factors, including the proliferation of Super PACs, the growing importance of digital marketing strategies, and the record-breaking fundraising efforts of each political party.

One landmark Supreme Court decision has also played a pivotal role. In 2010, Citizens United v FEC was decided by a 5-4 split decision.

The conservative nonprofit organisation Citizens United had contested campaign finance regulations after the FEC prevented it from promoting and broadcasting a film critical of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2008 election. Citizens United won.

This ruling struck down restrictions on corporations and unions using their treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. As a result, special interest groups gained the ability to allocate unlimited cash towards political campaigns, provided they remained uncoordinated with official campaign activities. The far-reaching consequences of this decision have fundamentally altered the landscape of political spending in elections.",How did Kamala Harris’s campaign rack up a debt after record fundraising?

"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,How Kamala Harris got more popular - The 19th*,"On June 27 — the day of the first and only presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — only 37 percent of Americans said they had a favorable opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris. More than half — 54 percent — held an unfavorable opinion, according to 538.

By August 5, Harris had officially become the nominee and her favorability rate had jumped to 43 percent. As of October 26, it was at 46 percent, meaning Harris had done something virtually unprecedented: She had become more likable since becoming a major party’s nominee.

Generally, Americans think less favorably of people who are running for president. This has been true, too, of the only other woman to be a major party’s nominee; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s unfavorability rating reached a record high in the final stretch of her campaign for the presidency. So it’s remarkable that any presidential candidate has seen their favorability continually improve since becoming a major party’s nominee. It is even more remarkable that that candidate is not only a woman, but a woman of color.

It remains to be seen whether Harris will be able to clinch a victory in what appears to be a dead-heat race between her and Trump, who is currently underwater with Americans: 43 percent view him favorably and 52 percent unfavorably. But the change in Americans’ perceptions of Harris sheds light on how they see vice presidents, women in positions of power and the country right now.

To understand the striking uptick in Harris’ favorability is to understand a truth in American politics — that the moment anyone becomes a candidate or nominee, scrutiny goes up and likability goes down. It’s a dynamic historically exacerbated by sexism. Harris’ trajectory bucks that trend.

The sexism is often fueled by a belief that has historically operated as a standard in American politics: Women can’t want it.

“For women, ambition is a four-letter word,” said Amanda Hunter, the former executive director for the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which for over two decades conducted nonpartisan research into women in politics, especially when in executive office. “When women show ambition, they tend to face a backlash.”

But Harris’ bid has an asterisk: Because of the way she became the nominee, voters perceive her as having stepped up and solved a problem by assuming a duty after President Joe Biden dropped out, Hunter said — something that they’re comfortable with seeing women do.

“I think that’s partially why people are reacting so positively. She’s been able to turn all of this around so quickly and really rise to the occasion … but she’s also done it under the umbrella of serving her party and serving her country, and not under the optics of ambition,” Hunter said.

Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University and the director of research for its Center for Women and Politics, said it’s important to take into account who else has occupied the national stage in the past few months: Biden, post-debate; Trump, swaying to music for 39 straight minutes and praising Hitler’s generals; and Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, maligning childless cat ladies and immigrants.

“Part of what’s happening is a credit to Harris, but also something that might be a bit outside of her, in that another solid Democratic person may have also benefited from that moment of change,” Dittmar said of the initial bump.

Harris had a net positive favorability with Americans for a short period about a month ago; she’s now slightly underwater, but still viewed more favorably than her opponent. Trump is particularly unpopular among women. According to a Quinnipiac University poll from October 30, men back Trump 57 percent — versus 37 percent for Harris. Women, meanwhile, back Harris 55 percent and 39 percent support Trump, who has been convicted of 34 felonies and found liable in civil court for sexual assault, defamation and fraud. He has also been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women.

Hunter said Harris has had to overcome what’s often referred to as the “imagination barrier,” or the perception among many voters that a woman can’t do well in a job that a woman has not held before. When voters are asked to picture a governor, the majority picture a man. A vice president? Also a man — and Harris is the first one not to fit the mold. The president of the United States? Well, you get the point.

These beliefs mean that the barriers Harris needs to overcome are two-fold. Not only is she running for an office most people can only imagine a man holding because a man has only ever held it, but they also might find themselves questioning her credentials because she’s also the first woman to hold her current job.

“With other vice presidents, people didn’t really question it because the man looked, sounded and acted like every other vice president that came before him. They sort of all looked a part, for lack of a better description,” Hunter said. “And so people weren’t really asking, ‘What is Mike Pence really doing every day?’ They just assumed he was probably doing important things.”

Harris entered the race with decades of experience navigating the double standards faced by women in politics — and especially women of color in politics. A number of former Harris aides who spoke with The 19th for this story said that this dynamic has also made her preternaturally skilled at tuning out the noise, opting to focus on the work rather than others’ expectations.

They say she’s also benefited from taking on the top spot in the campaign, allowing her to reintroduce herself.

An October survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization, found that a greater share of women voters now say that they trust Harris more than Trump when it comes to the economy, which they also name as their top concern in this election. This marks a notable shift from when this survey was conducted in June. Back then, Biden was still the Democratic nominee and women voters were evenly split on which party they believed could better help them manage rising costs.

The more recent survey also found that since Harris became the nominee, 64 percent of women voters say they are satisfied with their choice of presidential candidates for the 2024 race. Only 40 percent said the same in June, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. In addition, seven in 10 women now say they feel motivated to vote in the presidential election, compared with 45 percent in June.

Marci, a 52-year old woman from rural east Texas, is a conservative-leaning independent who was unenthusiastically but definitely voting for Trump when Biden was the Democratic standard-bearer.

“I’m just utterly frustrated with the shape of the country right now, and I feel in large part that’s due to Biden,” she said.

But Harris becoming the nominee moved her to the undecided camp.

“Being a female and having younger female relatives who are going to grow up in this country, I feel like Kamala is a better choice there because I feel like she’s going to lead us in a better direction,” Marci said.

Marci didn’t know much about Harris before she became the nominee, but in the months since, Marci has been taking the time to learn more about her. She privately researches claims she hears, including from her husband, whom she describes as a “rabid Republican.”

Marci works 40 hours a week at a local Home Depot store. For her, the economy is the biggest issue, followed by immigration.

Marci is still concerned about some of Harris’ policies — and Trump’s stability — but she has concluded that Harris is “a very intelligent woman.”

“I know she’s struggled to get to where she is and she’s had to fight hard for that. So I have to be, being a woman, respect that,” Marci said. “I feel like she’s got some good ideas about how to change things in our country.”

Makayla, 25, now lives in New Mexico but grew up in California’s Central Valley and describes herself as someone coming from “a low socioeconomic situation.” She now works at a nonprofit and hopes to work in government herself one day. After she saw the Biden-Trump debate, she wrote to her elected officials asking them to sign on to letters asking for Biden to drop out of the race.

Marci and Makayla are both respondents to the KFF poll who spoke on condition that only their first names were used.

When Biden did and endorsed Harris, Makayla said she was excited but skeptical. She liked her pick of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris’ running mate, seeing him as someone with a progressive track record. Her initial excitement has waned because, Makayla says, she has seen Harris trying to win over “moderate Republican, suburban wine moms and not their actual base.” But she is still voting for Harris, even if she wishes Harris had taken a more aggressive stance in outlining a roadmap for a ceasefire in Gaza and a more explicit progressive economic agenda, such as backing a single-payer health care system.

But, Makayla said, “I think she has done a really good job when she became the nominee of really explaining her story and sharing it with the American people — where she’s from and who she is.”

Makayla said that Harris doesn’t have “that kind of political charisma” she has typically associated with those running for president — but that Harris is who she says she is. “She’s a prosecutor — that’s who she is,” Makayla said. “She’s a pretty straightforward person, I think, because of that background.”

Current and former aides also point to Harris’ background as a prosecutor as the root of her pragmatism, saying it has made her focused on crafting deliverable results from the facts on the ground. It’s also made her good at delivering the message, they say.

Carmel Martin, Harris’ former domestic policy adviser who began working with her during her 2020 presidential campaign, said she thinks voters are “responding to the fact that she has a very positive and very future-looking orientation.”

Harris is “relentless” in making sure any policy proposal results in measurable, tangible results — and that her team comes up with clear, concise ways to communicate that to those who stand to be most impacted, Martin said.

Hunter said that message is also landing in a very different political climate — particularly for women voters — than it would have eight years ago.

The Women’s March following Trump’s inauguration, the virality of the #MeToo movement, the public reckoning spurred by the Black Lives Matter movement, the election of a record number of women governors and the caregiving crisis crystallized by the Covid-19 pandemic have collectively meant women are at the center of our politics.

“Voters right now, and over the last couple of years especially, have felt so cynical. In our focus groups, what we have heard is that they have felt like no one cares about them,” Hunter said. Harris seems to be addressing this narrative head-on, she added. “She’s been able to acknowledge the challenges that people are living through and then talk about how they’re going to fix them. And it’s resonating.”",How Kamala Harris got more popular  The 19th*,The 19th*,https://19thnews.org/2024/11/kamala-harris-favorability/

I’m Voting for Her Anyway. - Foreign Policy,"You might think a realist/restrainer like me would be leaning toward Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, especially given my dismay at how Biden and his colleagues have handled Gaza, the war in Ukraine, and some other foreign policy issues . Harris wasn’t responsible for those policies, but she has declined to say they were wrong when given the opportunity. Although her principal foreign policy advisor, Philip Gordon, has written sensible things about the limits of U.S. power and the folly of trying to remake whole regions in our image, there’s no sign that Harris’s own views on foreign policy lie outside the Beltway consensus or reflect a realist view of international affairs.

That’s why some self-described realists are enamored with them , and you could easily conclude that I shared their view.

At this point, there might only be a few dozen undecided voters left in the United States, so writing a column to convince people to vote the right way may be pointless.

That’s why some self-described realists are enamored with them, and you could easily conclude that I shared their view.

So why am I not ignoring Trump and Vance’s troubling deficiencies of character—which is putting it mildly—and planting a Trump-Vance sign in my yard? Let me count the ways.

First, as I noted repeatedly when Trump was president, he is not a realist, and you’re as likely to get sensible foreign policy from him as you were to get an education from Trump University. He is more accurately seen as a crude nationalist and unilateralist, and the “ism” that best captures him is narcissism. During his first term, he was better at garnering attention than making constructive diplomatic gains, which is why his reality show summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin went nowhere. He didn’t end any “forever wars” during his first term, gave the Defense Department more money that it didn’t need, and was perfectly content firing missiles into foreign countries to kill leaders he didn’t like. He was impulsive, crude, inattentive, and incapable of forging a clear strategy and sticking to it, which is why his four years in office were devoid of genuine foreign-policy achievements. The much-ballyhooed Abraham Accords don’t count, as they helped lay the groundwork for the carnage that is now convulsing the Middle East, just as critics had warned. (That’s what you get when a president lets his unqualified son-in-law play diplomat in a volatile region.)

And let’s not forget that Trump allowed Iran to restart its nuclear program by leaving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, abandoned the Paris climate accord, and weakened efforts to balance China by jettisoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership and picking fights with Asian allies instead. This is a foreign-policy record no serious realist should support. Nor would a realist think that sowing division and telling Americans to fear each other is the best way to strengthen the country, let alone make it great. Yet that is exactly what Trump has done throughout his career, and especially during this campaign.

None of this is surprising, given the long record of incompetence that is Trump’s business career. Its distinguishing features are not adroit dealmaking and shrewd management, but repeated bankruptcies, bilked customers, endless lawsuits, and a long history of felonious tax fraud. His supporters insist that his first term taught him to rely on his own people, but, unfortunately, he’s proven that he’s a terrible judge of talent. His first national security advisor lasted less than a month, and he burned through three more in a single term, along with multiple secretaries of state and defense. Staff turnover at Trump’s White House was one of the highest on record, and dozens of people who worked directly with him are adamantly opposed to giving him another shot.

Of course, Trump isn’t interested in hiring competent people to work in government; he wants loyalists who will do his bidding no matter how idiotic or illegal his decisions might be. His contempt for expertise is especially evident in his approach to science, about which he knows nothing. This blind spot was obvious in his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with his continued denial of the climate crisis. Harris understands that climate is a huge issue and that we need to do more to limit greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects we are already experiencing, while Trump still thinks it is a liberal hoax and favors policies that will make the problem much worse. Residents of Florida, take note.

Instead of appointing people sworn to defend the Constitution, who are competent at their jobs and committed to serving the public, he wants to populate the executive branch with personal flunkies. This is a deadly serious matter, because you cannot run a complex modern society without lots of well-trained, competent people who know what they are doing and aren’t vulnerable to political pressure. I’m talking about the civil servants who run the Treasury, the National Weather Service, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the various power grids on which ordinary life depends, the IRS, the Food and Drug Administration, and all the other institutions that allow our society to function.

Are these institutions perfect? No, because no organization made up of fallible human beings can be flawless. Would we be better off without them, or with an ignorant and willful president’s corrupt cronies in charge? Absolutely not. The United States has systematically underfunded key public agencies for decades (which is why government performance is often disappointing), and Trump (and the extremists who drafted Project 2025 for him) wants to make the problem worse. That won’t bother plutocrats who can buy all the services they might need or want, but it will render the United States an increasingly unpleasant and inefficient place for everyone else.

Third, Trump’s approach to foreign economic policy promises to be disastrous. His first-term tariffs were a bust—they didn’t shrink the trade deficit or alter China’s economic policies and did considerable harm to some sectors of the U.S. economy. Trump is now promising to double or triple down on those tariffs. Even today, he doesn’t understand that tariffs on foreign goods are a tax on American consumers, not a penalty that foreign exporters pay to us. (It was U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico, who paid for his dumb border wall, too.) The tariffs he’s proposing would rekindle inflation, reduce the dollar’s appeal as a reserve currency, and harm U.S. exporters. But don’t take my word for it—take a look at Martin Wolf’s concise and devastating assessment in the Financial Times. Harris might not do everything I’d like in terms of economic policy, but she’s also not going to adopt an approach to trade policy that has been rightly rejected for decades.

Most importantly, Trump is the only person in this race who poses a genuine threat to American democracy. Our system of government has its flaws, but it still affords most citizens enormous freedom and is capable of reform and renewal. It is clear from Trump’s entire career—and especially his career in politics—that he is contemptuous of the rule of law (hardly surprising given that he’s a convicted felon and confirmed sexual predator) and has zero commitment to preserving our constitutional order. If Harris is elected, she’ll undoubtedly do things I oppose, but she’s not going to impose an authoritarian system or refuse to leave office if she loses a reelection bid in 2028. Trump has already tried to do the latter, and there’s every indication he’d like to accomplish the former.

You think I’m exaggerating? I confess that I underestimated the danger Trump posed back in 2016, but I revised my view as the evidence piled up. The clearest indication comes from looking at who Trump admires. It is not people like Abraham Lincoln, FDR, or Nelson Mandela, it’s autocrats like Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orban, Mohammed bin Salman, and Benjamin Netanyahu—men as contemptuous of rules and norms as he is. He’d like to be as immune to checks and balances as they are, and if he gets his way, turning the clock back will not be easy and might even be impossible. Once a democracy collapses into autocracy, restoring it is usually a difficult and precarious process.

Because Trump is a gifted con man, it is not that surprising that he’s been able to bamboozle so many ordinary people, taking advantage of their anxieties about some of the changes that have occurred in the United States over the past 30 years. What is surprising is the number of well-educated and highly successful people who think Trump is on their side and won’t ever turn on them. I’m thinking of people like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, who remind me of those naïve and cocksure German politicians who thought they could control Adolf Hitler. If there’s one thing that’s clear about Trump (and it seems to be equally true of the shape-shifting Vance), it is that he would betray anyone if he thought it would advance his interests. Russian oligarchs like Boris Berezovsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky thought they could control Putin and that their wealth would protect them from retribution, and look what happened to them. If you’re a tech-bro gazillionaire and you think Trump is a trustworthy ally, you might want to reflect on what happened to former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. And this warning goes double for all the people who go to his rallies and seem to genuinely think he’s going to do something for them.

So come Nov. 5, my vote will be cast for Harris.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Harris says nation must accept election results while urging supporters to keep fighting - The Associated Press,"Follow AP’s coverage of Donald Trump’s transition back to the White House.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a sweeping rejection by American voters, Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump on Wednesday and encouraged supporters to continue fighting for their vision of the country.

The Democratic vice president said the battle would continue “in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square.”

“Sometimes the fight takes a while,” she said at Howard University, her alma mater, where she had hoped to make a victory speech after the election. “That doesn’t mean we won’t win.”

Harris’ decisive defeat shattered hopes that she could rescue Democrats’ chances after President Joe Biden’s reelection effort stalled and she replaced him at the top of the ticket.

She trailed in every battleground state to Trump, a Republican whom she described as an existential danger to the country’s foundational institutions. And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House — even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss.

Despite her stark warnings about Trump, Harris reached for optimism on Wednesday.

“It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it’s going to be OK,” she told supporters as some of them wiped tears from their eyes.

Biden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: “She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America’s future.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, was in the audience with his family. So were Reps. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, and Barbara Lee, both from Harris’ home state of California.

Before her speech, Harris called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. She told the crowd that “we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,” an implicit reference to Trump’s unwillingness to do the same four years ago.

Some in the audience expressed disappointment that Harris was not able to make history as the country’s first Black female president. Harris would also have been first U.S. president of South Asian descent

Gregory Pate, 38, said he appreciated that Harris said she was “committed to the fight and not looking at this as a permanent defeat, but just another obstacle that we have to go through as Black people.”

“I think it was perfect. I think that it was timely, and it was a message that I came to hear,” said Pate, of Fairfax, Virginia.

Jay Evans, of Greenbelt, Maryland, said after Harris’ spoke that he’s wistful for what could have been.

“We’re partly sad, because hearing her speak, she would have been an amazing person to bring the country together and to keep us in a better path,” Evans said.

After Trump lost to Biden, he directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, leading to a violent insurrection that interrupted the ceremonial certification of the election results.

Now Harris is expected to oversee the same certification process to finalize Trump’s victory as voters brush off concerns about the future of American democracy and return the former Republican president to the White House.

Biden plans to address the election results on Thursday. The White House said he spoke with Harris and Trump on Wednesday, and he invited the president-elect to meet with him soon.

David Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, said campaign staffers “left it all on the field for their country.”

“We dug out of a deep hole but not enough,” he said. “A devastating loss.”

Harris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86 years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump.

He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy.

It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed “the female Barack Obama.” Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.

Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party’s future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House’s leading advocate for abortion rights.

Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden’s departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention.

Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket.

But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden’s political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change.

Although Harris pitched “a new way forward,” she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary.

Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it’s unclear what role Harris will play in her party’s future.

“The work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,” wrote Jen O’Malley Dillon, Harris’ campaign chair, in a letter to staff. “I know the Vice President isn’t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.”",Harris says nation must accept election results while urging supporters to keep fighting  The Associated Press,The Associated Press,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-ddeae9fb378530159201ef4196cba9b3

Most political experts agree that Vice President Kamala Harris’ likeliest path to victory in the Electoral College lies through Pennsylvania—but there is a way for her to win without the swing state. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is the biggest battleground state this year and is expected to play an outsized role in deciding the election between Harris and former President Donald Trump.

Polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat in Pennsylvania. FiveThirtyEight’s polling average shows Trump ahead by just 0.2 points as of Sunday. Most experts say that whoever wins the Keystone State is likely to go on to win the White House and that Harris’ easiest path to victory is by carrying Pennsylvania and the other two “blue wall” states—Michigan and Wisconsin—that President Joe Biden won in 2020.

Donald Trump is a serious threat to the lives and opportunities of Black Americans and Black men.

Trump falsely accused the Exonerated Five and called for them to receive the death penalty.

His history as a landlord is checkered with repeated allegations of racial discrimination and outright refusal to rent to Black tenants.

Following the murder of George Floyd, Trump described Black protestors as “THUGS,” threatening that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

As president he referred to majority-Black nations as “s***hole countries.”

Recently, Trump spread dangerous lies about Black Haitians “eating the pets” of their neighbors.

If he’s reelected, things will get worse.

"Fri, 11 Oct 2024 15:01:01 GMT",Kemala Harris,Kamala Harris’ poll lead trails Biden and Clinton’s at same stage - College of Social Sciences and Humanities,"Newsweek, October 2024

With less than four weeks until Election Day and early voting underway in some states, Vice President Kamala Harris’ polling lead is trailing that of President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton at the same point in 2020 and 2016 respectively. RealClearPolling’s average of polls shows Harris has a 1.8 point lead over former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, as of Friday. Biden was leading Trump by 10.3 points on October 11, 2020, according to RealClearPolling’s average. Clinton, the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2016, was ahead of Trump by six points on the same date in 2020.

Trump’s victory in 2016 came as a surprise to the nation’s pollsters, as most polls has shown Clinton ahead of Trump throughout the 2016 campaign, though her advantage narrowed in many surveys in the final weeks before the election. In 2016, Clinton garnered almost three million more votes than Trump, but he won the Electoral College and the presidency.

Harris delivered a speech to the country and her supporters at Howard University in Washington D.C., her alma mater.

“While I concede this election,” Harris said, “I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.”

“I will never give up a fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams ambitions and aspirations,” she said. America, she added, “will never give up the fight for our democracy.”

Harris confirmed she called Trump to congratulate him on his election win, discussing the importance of a peaceful transfer of power with the president-elect. Biden has also called Trump to congratulate him and to invite him to the White House to discuss the transition. Biden plans to address the nation Thursday on the election results, the White House said.

Howard had served as her election night headquarters where Harris had hoped to deliver a victory speech Tuesday night. But as midnight approached on the East Coast and election results trickled in showing victories for Donald Trump, the cheers in the crowd became silent and the Harris campaign turned off its projected broadcasts of CNN. Instead, the DJ blared music from speakers to hype the crowd.

""We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to try to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken,"" campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said. ""So you won't hear from the vice president tonight. But you will hear from her tomorrow, because she will be back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters, but to address the nation.""

Cedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, spoke to supporters at Howard University saying Vice President Kamala Harris will not speak until Wednesday.

Harris’ surest way to 270 electoral votes was through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states Trump won in 2016 and President Joe Biden captured narrowly in 2020. But in state after state, including North Carolina and Georgia, Trump outperformed what he did in the 2020 election while Harris failed to do as well as Biden did in winning the presidency four years ago.

Trump's win against Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket, marks the second time he has defeated a female rival in a general election.

Harris rose to the top of the ticket after Biden exited the race with less than 100 days until Election day after a disastrous debate with the Republican nominee raised questions about his age and ability. Despite an initial surge of energy and excitement around her campaign, she struggled during a compressed timeline to convince disillusioned voters that she represented a break from an unpopular administration.

Harris focused particularly on reproductive rights, an issue that drew women to her candidacy after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision and states began implementing restrictions on abortions. And while abortion rights measures won in seven states, it wasn't enough get Harris the win.

Some states have added abortion rights to their Constitution, while two have rejected measures.

Trump, meanwhile, sought to court male voters with a hypermasculine approach. At the ballot box, Trump trounced Harris among men while about half of women backed Harris.

Trump ultimately won over voters with grand promises to improve the economy, block the flow of immigrants on the Southern border and his siren call to “make America great again.”

Overall, about half of Trump voters said inflation was the biggest issue factoring into their election decisions, according to evidence from the NBC News Exit Poll.

Nearly half — 45% — of all voters said they were worse off financially than they were four years ago. That was a higher level of dissatisfaction than what registered in exit polls in any recent election going back to 2008, when the election took place amid the financial crisis that propelled Barack Obama to victory. And though the economy is growing, with a low jobless rate and a booming stock market, 2 in 3 voters rated the U.S. economy poorly, a level higher than in 2020, when the country struggled to get in gear during the Covid pandemic.

Harris and Trump ran very different campaigns, with Harris promising to work with people who disagreed with her, while Trump warned about “the enemy within.” Besides abortion rights, she emphasized preserving democratic norms and tackling housing costs and other bread-and-butter economic issues.

Harris refused to be drawn into spats with Trump, when for example he questioned whether she had downplayed her identity as a Black woman. Harris’ mother came to the United States from India while her father is from Jamaica.

Trump characterized Harris as a socialist, though she has a more centrist record, and insulted her intelligence and her qualifications. Harris was San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general before becoming a U.S. senator. Biden tapped her as his running mate after she ended her own campaign for president in 2020.

But as part of the Biden administration, Harris struggled with other issues — the war in Gaza was the main one — over which she alienated many traditional Democratic voters.

By contrast, Trump presented a dark vision of America, and one that fact checkers found filled with exaggerations and inaccuracies. He called migrants “vermin” and charged they were committing violent crimes, made wild accusations about schools helping transgender schools transition without their parents’ consent, and repeated his false claims that he, not Biden, had won the 2020 presidential election. Late in the campaign, a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally insulted Puerto Ricans with a “floating island of garbage” punchline.

Trump has been found guilty of illegally influencing the 2016 election by making hush payments to a porn actress. He faces federal charges over his efforts to remain in the White House after the 2020 election and state charges in Georgia.

Vice President Kamala Harris has sought to reassure her supporters that, while they did not win the United States presidential election this year, the fight is far from over.

“The outcome of the election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” she said in a concession speech to a crowd of students and supporters at Howard University in Washington, DC, her alma mater.

“Hear me when I say the light of America’s promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.”

Her address on Wednesday afternoon was the first time Harris had spoken to her supporters since Republican candidate Donald Trump won the race.

Many had waited outside in tears on the university grounds on Tuesday night as the election unfolded. But an expected late-night speech never materialised: Her campaign director emerged to tell them that Harris was going to wait until more results came in.

By early Wednesday, the race had been called for Trump, who passed the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.

Mood upbeat

The mood on Wednesday afternoon was decidedly more upbeat when Harris spoke, with huge cheers and screams emanating from the crowd.

“I know folks have a range of emotions, I get it,” Harris said with a laugh.

“I spoke with Trump and congratulated him and told him we will help him with the transition and engage with a peaceful transfer of power.”

Harris then made a pointed dig at Trump who campaigned on his refusal to concede that he lost the 2020 presidential election to President Joe Biden.

“It’s a fundamental principle of a democracy that when we lose an election, we accept the result,” she said.

But Harris added that did not mean she was giving up.

“While I concede this election I don’t not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign,” she said. “To the young people, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed. Please know it will be OK.”

She added: “On the campaign, we say when we fight we win, sometimes the fight takes a while … It doesn’t mean we won’t win.”

Harris ended her speech by thanking her husband Doug Emhoff for his support.

“I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of all of us, I hope that is not the case,” she said.

Saviour for Democrats

Harris, 60, began campaigning after Biden stepped out of the race after stumbling badly in a June presidential debate with Trump. His performance sparked concerns about his ability to serve until the end of a second term in 2029, when he would be 86.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president. Harris quickly took over the Democratic campaign.

She was seen among many Democrats as a potential saviour for her party: the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent who could reach the Oval Office. Four years ago, she broke the same barriers for the vice presidency by becoming Biden’s second in command.

Harris ran an energetic campaign focused on moving away from Trump’s dark message of economic ruin and immigrants flooding the country. A key element of her platform was her advocacy for women’s reproductive freedom, a rallying cry that resonated with many young voters who flocked to her rallies.

The 2024 race was the first presidential campaign since the US Supreme Court struck down constitutional protection for abortion rights two years prior, in June 2022. The Harris campaign had hoped for a surge of support from women.

But it wasn’t enough to overcome the deep anger among US voters over high inflation, the cost of basic necessities such as food and housing, and worries about undocumented immigration, according to exit polls.

Trump’s promise to return to a “golden age of America” saw the key battleground states move decisively away from the Democrats.

He is due to take office on January 20, 2025, returning to power as the 47th US president four years after refusing to accept defeat to President Joe Biden.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)

“I am just in a panic about the outcome of the election,” said my good friend, a fellow Republican woman who is over 40 years my senior, when we spoke on Monday evening.

It was less than 12 hours before each of us were to report to our respective posts as election officials, making our quick phone call the last conversation of a political nature either of us would have until late the following night.

“Look at it this way,” I replied. “You’re 82 years old, so you’ve already got one foot in the grave. You might not even be around to have to suffer a full Kamala Harris presidency.”

In my defense, my Sophia Petrillo-esque comment did exactly what it was intended to do: it elicited a scream of laughter and a well-deserved exclamatory retort. Panic: dissipated. Huzzah.

Obviously, no one is coming to your friendly neighborhood opinion columnist (that’s me) for words of comfort to soothe the sting of election losses. It’s OK. I understand.

But I learned long ago that it’s just not worth it to fret over an upcoming election or let feelings of devastation creep in after my candidate loses. Losing is just as much a part of politics as winning is. One had best learn to cope if one is going to invest so much physical and emotional energy into it.

Rather than lament, I analyze. I have no problem articulating the reasons when a candidate loses, even when I support the candidate and hope they win. Especially when that candidate is Donald Trump.

Had Tuesday’s election gone the other way, I’d be dedicating this column to hashing all of the reasons Trump lost.

I’d discuss how that volatile personality made him his own worst enemy on too many occasions and rubbed too many voters in the wrong way. I’d argue that while the hatred for Trump from those who opposed his candidacy had been nothing short of irrational from the get-go, Republican voters should look next time for someone who doesn’t routinely give their detractors ammunition they crave.

Some of the mean tweets were/are funny — if calling Congressman Adam Schiff “Little Adam Schitt” is wrong, I don’t want to be right. But if Trump had lost, I’d surmise that the mean tweets irritated more than they amused.

I would rip that last debate performance to shreds — the one during which I resisted the urge to scream, “STOP TALKING ABOUT MIGRANTS EATING PEOPLES’ PETS, YOU JACKASS!”

(Fun fact: This is not actually the first time I’ve called Donald Trump a jackass in a respected newspaper.)

And though I will never dismiss the events at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as anything short of disgraceful on the part of those who stormed the building, I do not believe that Trump’s conduct that day meets the definition of “insurrection” or the incitement thereof. But I also would have suggested that the guy should have shut his yap instead of repeatedly claiming the 2020 election was stolen.

Even in the context of a hypothetical loss, there’s plenty of Trump-induced cringe to go around. How, then, did he not lose the most contentious election of our lifetimes to date?

In short, Kamala Harris was a terrible candidate — terrible enough to be bested by a deeply flawed character like Donald Trump.

Her entrance into the race was under the most pathetic circumstances imaginable. Harris was thrust into the role of presumed Democratic nominee to succeed the fast-fading Biden only days after insisting, as she had for months, that the President was cognitively capable of running for a second term as leader of the free world.

After leaving the race, the obviously declining Biden could have resigned from office, bidding a wistful, Reagan-esque farewell to enter the “sunset of [his] life.” Doing so would have guaranteed that Harris made history as the first female American president, while giving her a much stronger position for election as the de facto incumbent.

Biden didn’t resign. Harris was instead left to pick up the baton from one of the weakest presidents in American history, whose selfishness she shielded from the nation and whose confidence in her ability to fill the role was anything but apparent.

Why did he endorse her to succeed him, then? Because Joe Biden’s legacy is now inherently linked to that of Kamala Harris. To overlook her as his successor would be a glaring admission of his own failure of leadership for keeping an incompetent person in such an important position for three and a half years. Best to just clumsily step aside and let Harris ride in on a wave of joy with the fundraising spigot turned back on.

It was painfully obvious that Harris was lacking in substance. What little she had to offer was not in the form of concrete policies, and what policy insight she offered was in stark contrast to the same positions she offered during her ill-fated run in the 2020 Democratic primary.

Five years ago, Harris supported banning fracking and called Trump’s border wall “stupid,” and “wasteful,” a “vanity project.” In her desperate shift to the middle to appeal to moderate voters, she insisted in August that she would not ban fracking and expressed support for continuing a border wall.

Harris never explained her shift to the middle — not that the media had much chance to ask her. Her first solo media interview was, inexplicably, with a local news station in Philadelphia, more than six weeks after she replaced Biden as the party standard-bearer.

Interviews with alternative media sources got complicated. Top-ranked podcaster Joe Rogan was told if he wanted to interview her as he had Trump, he would need to fly to her location and be time-limited. The interview never happened.

One social media interview was so disastrous that the influencer decided not to air it. The Harris campaign had demanded in advance that the host not ask any questions about Gaza. During the interview, Harris reportedly switched her take and launched into talking about cooking with “bacon as a spice,” to the shock and non-amusement of her devout Muslim host. When the host asked to return to the original topic of airplane conduct, Harris, acting on campaign staff advice, started bloviating about anchovies on pizza.

Harris’ first network interview on CNN required a wingman — her vice presidential sidekick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The selection of Tiananmen Tim over a more moderate (and far more appealing) running mate like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear was itself a major Harris campaign blunder. Beneath the veneer of joy and confidence, Harris obviously harbored insecurities about being upstaged by a vice presidential nominee clearly better-suited for the presidency than she.

The self-described “knucklehead” Walz didn’t pose that threat. Walz was a charming addition to the ticket until the public began to realize that he had evidently attended the Joe Biden School of Telling Tales About Things that Never Happened, at which his dissertation was a made-up story of his being at Tiananmen Square during the pro-democracy protests in China in 1989. In reality, Walz was still home in Nebraska during the protests.

As Trump showed us in 2016 and again last week, even the most ridiculous characters can earn the trust of voters if they connect with them on the issues that matter. In all fairness, plenty of Harris/Walz supporters — the ones that came included in the presidential nominee handoff package as ones who would vote for anybody in order to defeat Trump — cited anger over abortion law changes and fears about democracy as their top issues.

But it turns out that the American electorate is more likely to need groceries they can afford than they are to need abortions. And they’re more likely to fear the consequences of the 10 million people who have entered our country by crossing the southern border illegally — including over 390 on the terror watchlist — than they are concerned that Trump might be the next Hitler.

Trump and Vance, meanwhile, each seemed to understand that most Americans listed the economy and immigration as their top two issues, and that the issue extended to pretty much every demographic in the country. They didn’t need to win every category of voter, necessarily — they just needed to make inroads with various groups and outperform the Trump totals from 2020.

They did, significantly cutting into Biden’s 2020 lead with voter groups such as Latino men. In Starr County, Texas, which is 97% Latino, Trump was the first Republican to earn a majority in almost 130 years.

At the end of the day, voters will vote for who they feel understands them best. This year, the candidate that best demonstrated to voters that their frustrations have been heard was Donald Trump. Fewer could say the same about Kamala Harris.

My much-older friend and I understand each other pretty well. After the polls closed on Tuesday night, we bounced around town partying with other Republican election nerds, watching the returns come in and staying up until the wee hours to see it live when the race for president was called. We were both 40, young and carefree that night.

We spent the next day crashed on couches, both of us feeling like we were 82.

The Washington Roundtable discusses the final stretch of Kamala Harris’s Presidential campaign, including a recent media blitz on podcasts and television shows. The Vice-President has never been entirely comfortable with the interview format. “She doesn’t ruminate and reflect,” the staff writer Evan Osnos says. “I think it’s the self-protection that comes with being aware of people who are always going to doubt her capacity to make history.” Osnos’s deeply reported profile of Vice-President Kamala Harris, “Kamala Harris’s Hundred-Day Campaign,” has just been published.

BBC correspondent reports from near-empty Harris event

Kamala Harris is preparing to speak to the US public later on Wednesday after calling Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory. The defeated Democrat spoke to her rival on Wednesday afternoon and they discussed ""the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans"", a Harris aide told journalists. Harris cancelled her expected election night appearance at Howard University in Washington DC, as her prospects of victory began to recede. The current vice-president is now expected to speak at the venue at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT).

She did not concede on election night, despite it becoming clear by the early hours of Wednesday that her Republican rival had secured enough votes in key swing states to win. Trump has now won enough key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin, to secure the presidency, with several states left to declare. Trump is also beating Harris in the popular vote - the first Republican to lead nationally since George W Bush in 2004. In a statement, Trump described his victory as one ""our country has never seen before"". ""I will fight for you, for your family, and your future. Every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body,"" he told voters. He vowed to ""unlock America's glorious destiny"" and promised his presidency would deliver ""the golden age of America"". As expected, Trump stormed to victory in conservative strongholds across the US, while Harris won liberal states from New York to California.

Harris saw a surge in popularity after she became the Democratic Party's nominee in June following Joe Biden's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate. Her team sought to strike a more optimistic vision than the portrait of American decay presented by Trump, focusing heavily on securing abortion rights. Trump, by contrast, frequently targeted Harris with highly personal attacks during the campaign, variously calling the vice-president ""stupid"", ""lazy"", and ""dumb as a rock"". He also questioned her racial identity during the early stages of the campaign. In a message to staff, Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillion, said losing the election was ""unfathomably hard"" and will take a ""long time to process"". ""But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency starts now,"" she said in an email obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. ""I know the vice president isn’t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.""

How swing state voters in Georgia felt on election day

The former California senator was running to become the first woman, black woman and South Asian-American to win the presidency. Exit poll data suggests that the Democratic nominee may have under-performed with women. Some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, below the 57% of women Joe Biden won in 2020. Black and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, exit poll data suggested. The campaign faced criticism at times for its failure to expand on a clear economic message, an issue which was extremely important to Americans who have faced several years of rising inflation.

About 86 million voters cast their ballots early during one of the most turbulent campaigns in recent American history. The Republican party enjoyed a resurgence across the country, winning a number of key congressional battles in key states and taking back control of the Senate. The Republicans wrested two seats in West Virginia and Ohio from the Democrats and saw off a stiff challenge in Texas. Neither party seemed to have an overall edge in the House, which Republicans narrowly control. If the party does regain control of both chambers, it would make it easier for Trump to push through his agenda - which includes mass deportations of illegal migrants and sweeping tax cuts.

"Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Why has Kamala Harris downplayed her gender and race in the US election? - Al Jazeera English,"Experts say that Harris has avoided highlighting ‘identity politics’, as election rivals seek to paint her as a ‘DEI hire’.

When Hillary Clinton spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 as the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major party, she was introduced with a video montage of all the men that had held the office until that point. As she appeared on screen, the montage crashed into shards to the sound of broken glass.

It wasn’t a subtle message. “We just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling,” Clinton said.

Eight years later, the second woman to clinch the Democratic Party’s nomination has chosen to go in a different direction. She doesn’t focus on her gender, nor on the fact that, should she win, she would be the second Black president and the first South Asian one.

Clinton’s campaign slogan was “I’m with her”, and she donned white pantsuits in reference to the suffragette movement. But Kamala Harris has made it a point to skirt questions about her gender – and her race – at times appearing visibly annoyed by them.

“Next question, please,” Harris answered during her first televised interview with her running mate Tim Walz when asked to respond to Republican candidate Donald Trump’s comment that she had “turned Black”.

It’s a strategy that precedes her run for president. In 2017, for example, when she was California’s attorney general, reporters asked her what it was like to be the first woman on the job.

She famously responded: “I really don’t know how to answer that question because you see, I’ve always been a woman, but I’m sure a man could do the job just as well.”

While there is no question Harris’s candidacy is historic in more than one way, she has deliberately downplayed the more identity-focused aspects of her campaign in favour of pitching herself as a candidate for “all Americans”.

Cracked ceilings

That’s in part because so-called identity politics are often a divisive issue for the electorate she’s trying to unify, particularly in recent years, with a backlash brewing in some quarters to progressive “woke” politics.

But analysts say it is also because the historic nature of her run is already visible to all and needs little emphasising.

Other candidates in past elections have already broken race and gender barriers. As a result, experts say, it no longer seems implausible that a woman of colour should hold the highest office in the land.

“Her gender and race really aren’t part of the narrative of this campaign. It’s just been normalised to an unprecedented degree,” Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher focused on gender, told Al Jazeera.

She credited Clinton, in part, for paving the way. “Most voters are much more concerned about policy and what she might do for them than the historic nature of this campaign.”

Undem also noted that emphasising Harris’s race and gender plays into efforts to weaponise identity against her, as some Republicans have attempted to do in branding her a “DEI” candidate, short for “diversity, equity and inclusion”.

Trump, for instance, has questioned her race and made sexist insinuations about her personal relationships, and his running mate JD Vance attacked her lack of biological children.

“Obviously, racism is still an issue in this country. Sexism is still an issue,” said Undem. “Those don’t change overnight.”

But public perceptions are changing, she added, pointing to polls that show women are increasingly seen not only as equal but as better leaders than men.

Still, progress is not linear, Undem stressed. The election of the first Black president, Barack Obama, was followed by the election of the man who sought to paint him as a foreigner, Trump.

The first female presidential candidate, Clinton, ultimately lost to Trump, a man accused of sexual misconduct by two dozen women. That election was followed by a women-led protest movement, waves of protest for racial justice and the #MeToo moment.

“Things are changing,” said Undem. “But we’re still in the middle of it.”

A post-identity politics campaign

Rather than follow Clinton’s lead and “leaning into” the gender politics of her candidacy, Harris seems to have taken a page out of Obama’s book. Though the historic nature of his candidacy and win were in plain sight in 2008, Obama’s campaign did not make it the central theme of his run.

“Obama’s campaign in 2008 wasn’t about him making history. It was about what he was going to do for the American people and how he was going to help particularly middle-class families improve their lives,” said Mike Nellis, an adviser to Harris’s 2020 campaign and a founder of the group “White Dudes for Harris”.

“Kamala is running the same type of campaign, which is, her campaign is not about her. It’s about you: ‘Here’s how I’m gonna help you,’” he added.

Nellis also said that Harris has little time to make her case to American voters. After all, she only entered the race in July, after the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden.

“Talking about the history-making aspect of it would be a waste of time because it’s self-evident. Everybody knows and sees that,” Nellis said. “But also, it’s more important that she communicate to people what she’s going to do, particularly because she has a condensed timeline.”

Nellis argued that Harris is running a “post-identity politics” presidential campaign, seeking to unify voters disenchanted with the divisiveness and vitriol of recent US elections.

That’s striking a sharp contrast to her rival, Trump – who has made the campaign primarily about himself but has also exploited grievances between communities, most notably with his rhetoric on immigration.

“Trump’s entire campaign is based on resting that thumb on the scale, stoking the divisions, telling predominantly white men that all your problems are because of immigrants or because of feminists or whatever,” Nellis said. “Harris is running a campaign for all Americans. She’s being smart.”

Rainbow flags and pink hats

While the Harris campaign has often downplayed her identity, her team has, at times, made subtle references to it, particularly when targeting certain communities.

That was the case when her running mate, Tim Walz, spoke to students from historically Black colleges in Georgia.

He told them Harris “doesn’t talk about the historic nature of her candidacy. She just does the work”. He then added, “But I think for all of us, there is a moment in time to understand what’s happening here. I think, I feel, especially amongst young people, they recognise what it means, what this candidacy means.”

But while Harris’s identity has earned her the enthusiastic support of some voters, Undem noted that most make their choice based on much more than identity affinity.

“Very rarely do we hear voters say, ‘I’m voting for her because she’s a woman,’” said Undem. “What they’re adamant about, especially Republican women and independent women, is, ‘I’m not going to vote for her just because she’s a woman.’”

Analysts told Al Jazeera that efforts to highlight Harris’s identity as a Black and South Asian woman have fallen flat with certain progressive voters, who disagree with her support for Israel’s war in Gaza.

“Kamala Harris is leaning into her identity with certain audiences and not with others, but that idea of sort of tailoring your story to your audience is part of politics,” Dalia Mogahed, former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, told Al Jazeera.

“I do think that her identity is sometimes emphasised with Muslim voters as a way to convince them to overlook some of the issues around Gaza and to contrast her with a very white male Trump, who weaponises racial tropes against the Muslim community and against other communities of colour.”

But that pandering might backfire, critics say.

“When you’re reducing it to identities like being a woman, or African American, or queer … They use identity reductionism to really just create fragmentation and fear,” said Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida. “They just decorate themselves with rainbow flags or pink hats so that people are plugging their nose and voting. But it hasn’t worked. And it will not work.”",Why has Kamala Harris downplayed her gender and race in the US election?

Her friends, aides and political allies have said in the hours since her loss to former President Donald J. Trump that it is too soon to even contemplate, let alone plan, the next phase of her life, except to say that the 60-year-old Ms. Harris will have plenty of options.

Like the defeated presidential nominees who came before her, Ms. Harris is experiencing incredible political whiplash.

Harris said she told Trump on the phone Wednesday that she'll help with a peaceful transfer of power, which got a cheer from the crowd at Howard.

""We must accept the results of this election,"" the vice president said.

""A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,"" Harris said, alluding to Trump's refusal to acknowledge his loss of the 2020 election.

Harris' defeat came as Trump won the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin overnight. Trump won another swing state, Michigan, on Wednesday.

Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how President Joe Biden handled them. Trump's return to the White House also suggests that Democrats were not motivated enough by the prospect of electing the first female president and that its base's fury over the Supreme Court's revocation of constitutional abortion protections has waned since 2022.

President Joe Biden’s remark apparently calling Donald Trump’s supporters “garbage” quickly brought a backlash, but experts told Newsweek it is unlikely to have much of an impact on the election. The president made the comment in response to a comedian who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in New York City, where some speakers made crude and racist remarks on Sunday.

Puerto Ricans are “good, decent honorable people,” Biden said on a call organized by Voto Latino, a grassroots advocacy organization, on Tuesday. “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” he said in a reference to Trump, according to the White House transcript of Biden’s remarks. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”

Related: Trump Tax Proposals

With less than one month left in the 2024 presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris has provided updated details of her fiscal and economic agenda. On tax A tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. policy, Harris carries forward much of President Biden’s FY 2025 budget, including higher taxes aimed at businesses and high earners. She would also further expand the child tax credit A tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer’s final tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. A tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions, which reduce taxable income, rather than the taxpayer’s tax bill directly. (CTC) and various other tax credits and incentives while exempting tips from income tax.

On a gross basis, we estimate that Vice President Harris’s proposals would increase taxes by about $4.1 trillion from 2025 to 2034. After taking various credits and tax cuts into account, Harris would raise about $1.7 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis, and after factoring in reduced revenue from slower economic growth, the net revenue increase comes to $642 billion. We estimate the proposed tax changes would reduce long-run GDP by 2.0 percent, the capital stock by 3.0 percent, wages by 1.2 percent, and employment by about 786,000 full-time equivalent jobs.

We find the tax policies would raise top tax rates on corporate and individual income to among the highest in the developed world, slowing economic growth and reducing competitiveness. The tax credits and other carveouts would complicate the tax code, run more spending through the IRS, and, together with various price controls, fail to improve affordability challenges in housing and other sectors.

Many tax policies remain unspecified, including how Harris might deal with next year’s expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Harris has not clearly indicated if or how her spending priorities align with the FY 2025 budget proposals. Depending on where she lands on these issues, the deficit impacts could be large.

In a possible scenario in which she extends the TCJA for all those earning under $400,000 and adopts all the spending proposals specified in the FY 2025 budget and others announced on the campaign trail, we estimate the net effect of her policies would increase deficits by $2.3 trillion over the next decade, measured on a conventional basis. Including the economic impacts of the tax increases, the net effect could increase deficits by roughly $3.4 trillion over the next decade.

The wide range of possibilities reflects considerable uncertainty about her fiscal policy stance, leaving a large void regarding how she might deal with the already unprecedented, dangerous, and unsustainable federal debt trajectory.

Detailed Harris Tax Proposals

Harris’s tax plan relies on higher taxes on businesses and high earners to raise new revenues as outlined in President Biden’s FY 2025 budget with some revisions (to capital gains taxes, as noted), combined with several tax credits. All provisions are modeled as starting in calendar year 2025 unless otherwise noted.

Major business provisions modeled:

Increase the corporate income tax A corporate income tax (CIT) is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax.

Increase the corporate alternative minimum tax introduced in the Inflation Inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spending power.

Quadruple the stock buyback tax implemented in the Inflation Reduction Act from 1 percent to 4 percent

Make permanent the excess business loss limitation for pass-through businesses

Further limit the deductibility of employee compensation under Section 162(m)

Increase the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax rate from 10.5 percent to 21 percent, calculate the tax on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and revise related rules

Repeal the reduced tax rate on foreign-derived intangible income (FDII)

Major individual, capital gains, and estate tax An estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual’s taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. The tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs.

Expand the base of the net investment income tax (NIIT) to include nonpassive business income and increase the rates for the NIIT and the additional Medicare tax to reach 5 percent on income above $400,000

Increase top individual income tax An individual income tax (or personal income tax) is levied on the wages, salaries, investments, or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income. The Federal Income Tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. Though barely 100 years old, individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the U.S.

Tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at 28 percent (as opposed to 39.6 percent as in the Biden budget) for taxable income Taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax, after deductions and exemptions. For both individuals and corporations, taxable income differs from—and is less than—gross income.

Limit retirement account contributions for high-income taxpayers with large individual retirement account (IRA) balances

Tighten rules related to the estate tax

Tax carried interest as ordinary income for people earning more than $400,000

Limit 1031 like-kind exchanges to $500,000 in gains

Exempt tipped income from income taxation for occupations where tips are currently customary

Expand the Section 195 deduction limit for startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.

Major tax credit provisions modeled:

Revive and make permanent the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) child tax credit (CTC) and increase the CTC for newborns to $6,000 in the first year of life

Permanently extend the ARPA earned income tax credit (EITC) expansion for workers without qualifying children

Provide a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers over four years

We also modeled various miscellaneous provisions for corporations, pass-through businesses, and individuals, including several energy-related tax hikes largely pertaining to fossil fuel production. While the Biden budget improperly characterized fossil fuel provisions as subsidies, many are deductions for costs (or approximations of costs) incurred.

Major provisions not modeled by us, but included in total fiscal impacts based on Biden administration estimates:

Repeal the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and replace it with an undertaxed profits rule (UTPR) consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 global minimum tax model rules

Replace FDII with unspecified research and development (R&D) incentives

Create a 25 percent “billionaire minimum tax” to tax unrealized capital gains of high-net-worth taxpayers

Permanently extend the ARPA premium tax credits (PTCs) expansion (we do include PTCs in our distributional analysis)

Create America Forward tax credits, which provide support for investment in specific industries subject to additional eligibility criteria

Changes to tax compliance and administration

Long-Run Economic Effects of Vice President Harris’s Tax Proposals

We estimate the tax changes in Harris’s tax proposals would reduce long-run GDP by 2.0 percent, the capital stock by 3.0 percent, wages by 1.2 percent, and employment by about 786,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Harris’s tax proposals would decrease American incomes (as measured by gross national product, or GNP) by 1.8 percent in the long run, reflecting offsetting effects of increased taxes and reduced deficits, as debt reduction reduces interest payments to foreign owners of the national debt.

Raising the corporate income tax rate to 28 percent is the largest driver of the negative effects, reducing long-run GDP by 0.6 percent, the capital stock by 1.1 percent, wages by 0.5 percent, and full-time equivalent jobs by 125,000.

Our economic estimates likely understate the effects of the Harris tax plan since they exclude two novel and highly uncertain yet large tax increases on high earners and multinational corporations, namely a new minimum tax on unrealized capital gains and a UTPR consistent with the OECD/G20 global minimum tax model rules. Nor do we include the proposed unspecified R&D incentives that would replace the lower tax rate on foreign-derived intangible income FDII.

Revenue and Debt Effects of Vice President Harris’s Tax Proposals

Across the major provisions modeled by Tax Foundation, we estimate that Harris’s tax plan would raise $2.2 trillion of tax revenue from corporations and $1.2 trillion from individuals from 2025 through 2034.

For tax proposals from the Biden FY 2025 budget, we relied on estimates from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for provisions we did not model, including the billionaire minimum tax, UTPR, various international tax changes for oil and gas companies, smaller international tax changes, improvements to tax compliance and administration, and unspecified R&D incentives to replace FDII.

In total, accounting for all provisions, we estimate the budget would raise just over $4.1 trillion in gross revenue from tax changes over the 10-year budget window.

Tax cuts, like the tax exemption A tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. for tip income, the expanded deduction for startup expenses, and the unspecified incentive to replace FDII, reduce gross revenue by $235 billion, while expanded tax credits reduce the revenue by another $2.2 trillion. This results in a net tax increase of about $1.7 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis.

On a dynamic basis, factoring in reduced tax revenues resulting from the smaller economy, we estimate Harris’s tax plan would raise about $642 billion over 10 years.

The economic harm from Harris’s tax hikes would also greatly reduce the ability to address an emerging debt crisis. Under current law, the debt-to-GDP ratio will hit 201 percent in 40 years, while the Harris tax plan on a conventional basis would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 189 percent. However, after factoring in reduced tax collections and a smaller economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline only slightly, to 200 percent.

Adding more uncertainty and potentially increasing deficits substantially, Harris may extend the TCJA for people making under $400,000, as the FY 2025 budget mentions but does not formally include in the budget accounting. Harris could accomplish TCJA extension in many ways, but all possibilities would likely have a high fiscal cost, given that about 98 percent of taxpayers earn less than $400,000.

For instance, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) has estimated the cost of TCJA permanence for people earning less than $400,000 could range from $2.1 trillion to $3.6 trillion over 10 years, with a central estimate of $3.0 trillion. Using CRFB’s central estimate, the cost of extending TCJA for all people earning less than $400,000 would be about $2.2 trillion over a decade, in addition to the cost of Harris’s proposed child tax credit expansion.

Vice President Harris has not specifically outlined all her proposed changes to federal spending. While we do not assume any additional spending as part of our formal score, Harris has proposed investing in affordable childcare and long-term care programs, including an expansion of Medicare, among other unspecified spending proposals, which would reduce net revenue collection further.

To tally up the range of potential deficit impacts from Harris’s proposals, we include as a proxy for potential spending the net change in spending according to CRFB’s central estimate of $1.8 trillion, which reflects net spending increases specified in the FY 2025 budget and other campaign announcements covering border security, support for business, early education and childcare, higher education, family and medical leave, and long-term care programs.

Assuming $1.8 trillion of additional spending and a $2.2 trillion revenue loss for TCJA extension, Harris’s combined fiscal policies could add as much as $2.3 trillion to deficits over the next decade on a conventional basis.

Under this scenario, and after accounting for the economic effects of the tax increases, we estimate deficits could increase by roughly $3.4 trillion over the next decade on a dynamic basis.

Alternatively, Harris could specify additional tax increases to offset the cost of TCJA extension, which would have additional negative impacts on the economy, or Harris could simply allow the TCJA to expire. Harris could also abandon part or all of the FY 2025 spending proposals.

Distributional Effects of Vice President Harris’s Tax Proposals

Vice President Harris’s tax plan would raise marginal income tax rates faced by higher earners and corporations while expanding tax credits for lower-income households, resulting in substantially increased redistribution of income through the tax code. Our modeling of the distributional effects on after-tax income After-tax income is the net amount of income available to invest, save, or consume after federal, state, and withholding taxes have been applied—your disposable income. Companies and, to a lesser extent, individuals, make economic decisions in light of how they can best maximize their earnings. only includes specified tax proposals and does not include the impact of drug pricing provisions, the 25 percent billionaire minimum tax, the undertaxed profits rule, miscellaneous tax credits, IRS enforcement, or spending program changes.

The Harris tax plan would redistribute income from high earners to low earners. The bottom 60 percent of earners would see increases in after-tax income in 2025, while the top 40 percent of earners would see decreases. After-tax income for the bottom quintile would increase by 16.5 percent, largely from expanded tax credits. In contrast, the top 1 percent of earners would experience a 9.5 percent decrease in after-tax income.

The bottom quintile would see a slightly smaller 13.6 percent increase in after-tax income in 2034 on a conventional basis, while the top two quintiles would see decreases in their after-tax incomes. The top 1 percent would see a 7.3 percent decrease in after-tax income.

On a long-term dynamic basis, the smaller economy would reduce after-tax incomes relative to the conventional analysis. On average, tax filers in the top three quintiles would experience a drop in after-tax incomes, while the bottom quintile would still see an increase, albeit reduced to 11.8 percent, driven by the permanent changes to the CTC, EITC, and PTC.

Analysis of Harris’s Tax Credit and Tax Cut Proposals

Like the Biden administration, Harris’s tax plan puts a heavy emphasis on tax credits. Harris would restore the CTC expansion under the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which increased the credit from $2,000 under current law to $3,000 for older children and $3,600 for younger children for 2021 only. She would further increase the credit amount for newborns to $6,000, resulting in a CTC that provides $6,000 for children under one year old, $3,600 for children two through five, and $3,000 for children six and older. The ARPA expansion also removed work and income requirements to claim the credit, providing the maximum credit to qualifying individuals regardless of whether they had earned income, thus much of the expansion is technically spending administered by the IRS.

Tax Foundation estimates Harris’ CTC expansion would cost about $1.6 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis. The expansion would shrink long-run economic output by about 0.1 percent by removing the credit’s phase-in and lengthening the credit’s phaseout, thus raising marginal tax rates for workers along both ranges. The smaller economy would result in further revenue losses for the federal government, increasing the fiscal cost to $1.7 trillion over the next decade.

Harris would extend or make permanent the expansion of health insurance PTC subsidies enacted under ARPA, which are set to expire at the end of 2025, and expand the EITC for single and joint filers who do not claim children on their tax returns. Over 10 years, permanence for the PTCs would cost about $238 billion, and the EITC expansion about $160 billion.

Harris also proposes several new housing tax incentives and penalties. For housing construction, she would expand the low-income housing tax credit (a similar proposal in the FY 2025 budget would cost $37 billion over a decade) and create a tax credit for the construction of starter homes. However, Harris would limit deductions for interest and depreciation Depreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and discouraging investment. for large property investors.

Expanding a proposal in the FY 2025 budget, the Harris campaign proposes providing an average of $25,000 for all eligible first-time homebuyers, with additional support for first-generation homebuyers. Depending on how the subsidy is structured and limited, the fiscal cost would be about $100 billion over four years, based on the plan’s aim of reaching 4 million first-time homebuyers. Other housing credits and related subsidies specified in the FY 2025 budget would cost approximately another $100 billion over the next decade.

While the details are unclear, Harris has announced she would end taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers and work with Congress to establish guardrails on the policy. The exemption itself, and any safeguards added, would add to the complexity of the tax code overall while failing to benefit many low-income earners, given the small share of the population working in tipped occupations. We estimate that an exemption could cost around $118 billion over the 10-year budget window on a conventional basis.

Harris has proposed expanding the Section 195 deduction for business startup costs from its current level of $5,000 to $50,000. Based on past revenue estimates of similar proposals from the Joint Committee on Taxation, we estimate the change would reduce revenue by about $24.5 billion over the 10-year budget window on a conventional basis. The economic impacts are uncertain but small given the revenue impact; to the extent the policy allows more businesses to recover costs, it will boost business investment and potentially economic dynamism.

In addition, the Harris campaign recently published a proposal for “America Forward” credits. While the campaign has not released a specified design of the credits, they have suggested the program would cost around $100 billion and would be “paid for by a portion of the proceeds of international tax reform.” Without more specifics, the proposed changes to international tax policy may already be included in the tax hikes proposed by Biden and adopted by Harris, raising the risk that this offset could be double counted.

While some form of pro-investment incentive is welcome, the policy has numerous problems: it would be limited to an arbitrary set of industries, including designated advanced and strategic industries as well as designated traditional or legacy industries, but not actually available to everyone. The credits would also be conditioned on a handful of other social goals, adding complexity and depleting the power of the incentives.

Subsidies and Price Controls Likely to Backfire

Many, but not all, of Harris’s housing policy proposals flow through the tax code. In terms of non-fiscal policy levers, the Harris plan includes regulatory streamlining to make construction easier, a crackdown on certain pricing tools in rental property management, and a new fund for public housing.

Harris’s reliance on subsidies for supply-constrained housing would be economically harmful for families, as it would boost demand and lead to higher housing prices. While some of her policies do target supply, like the expanded low-income housing tax credit and the credit for starter homes, these boutique tax breaks have not been effective historically.

Subsidies for different niches of the housing market are a poor substitute for better tax treatment of housing investment broadly. Multifamily housing construction still has not recovered to 1986 levels, as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the deductibility of investment.

Instead of reversing that poor tax treatment, the Harris package would further penalize rental housing construction by peeling back depreciation and interest deductions for certain large property investors, reducing investment incentives. These penalties would be in addition to a Biden-Harris administration proposal aimed at capping rent increases by disallowing certain deductions for depreciation.

Harris would deploy economically ruinous price controls in several other ways. Harris would cap the cost of insulin at $35 and out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs at $2,000 for all households, accelerate the speed of Medicare negotiations for prescription drug prices as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, and ban certain price increases for food and groceries.

Price controls harm consumers by reducing incentives to produce price-controlled goods. For example, the price controls on prescription drugs are likely deterring new drug development, resulting in up to 135 fewer drugs brought to market through 2039. Harris’s proposed price controls for groceries poorly address a problem that does not exist, as grocery profit margins are much lower than average across industries.

While not a tax policy, the Harris campaign’s proposal to expand Medicare coverage to include at-home long-term care services is a significant expansion of the program that was not included in the Biden administration’s budget. A Brookings Institution estimate of the cost of adding an in-home long-term care benefit would cost roughly $40 billion per year, and CRFB estimates it would cost $200 billion over 10 years as a central estimate.

Top Tax Rates Would Be among the Highest in the Developed World

Harris’s subsidies would largely be funded by raising top tax rates on corporate and individual income to levels far above international norms.

The current top combined corporate tax rate—including the average of state rates—is 25.6 percent. Harris would increase it to 32.2 percent, the second-highest corporate tax rate in the OECD (behind Colombia’s 35 percent).

The current top combined personal tax rate is 42.5 percent, consisting of the top federal rate (37 percent) and the average of state and local rates. This is about equal to the OECD average. Under Harris, the top combined rate would rise to 45.1 percent before accounting for the proposed 5 percent additional Medicare tax, half of which falls on the employer. Including the employee-side portion would raise the top rate to 47.6 percent.

The current top combined capital gains tax A capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. rate is 29.1 percent, consisting of the 20 percent capital gains tax rate, the 3.8 percent NIIT, and the average of state and local income tax rates on capital gains. By taxing high earners’ capital gains at 28 percent and raising the NIIT to 5 percent, Harris’s proposals would raise the top tax rate on capital gains to 38.3 percent—the second highest in the OECD (behind Denmark’s 42 percent). Similarly, under Harris’s proposals, the top tax rate on dividends would be nearly the highest in the OECD.

The combined integrated rate on corporate income reflects the two layers of tax corporate income faces: first at the entity level through corporate taxes and again at the shareholder level through capital gains and dividends taxes. Currently, the top combined integrated tax rate on corporate income distributed as capital gains is 47.2 percent. Under Harris’s proposals, it would rise to 58.1 percent—the highest in the OECD.

By placing a higher burden on work, saving, and investment, the Harris tax plan would reduce competitiveness and weaken key drivers of US economic growth, shrinking GDP by about 2.0 percent over the long run.

Modeling Notes

We use the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Tax Model to estimate the impact of tax policies, including recent updates allowing detailed modeling of US multinational enterprises. The model produces conventional and dynamic revenue and distributional estimates of tax policy. Conventional estimates hold the size of the economy constant and attempt to estimate potential behavioral effects of tax policy. Dynamic revenue estimates consider both behavioral and macroeconomic effects of tax policy on revenue. The model also produces estimates of how policies impact measures of economic performance such as GDP, GNP, wages, employment, capital stock, investment, consumption, saving, and the trade deficit.

Note, however, that our conventional and dynamic estimates for the stock buyback tax do not account for behavioral shifting from buybacks to dividends, which would also shift the individual income tax base The tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates. from capital gains to dividends.

Regarding Vice President Harris’s proposed changes to the GILTI regime, we modeled most of the major changes, including the 75 percent GILTI inclusion rate, country-by-country application, the reduction in the foreign tax credit (FTC) haircut to 5 percent, elimination of the qualified business asset investment (QBAI) exemption, and elimination of the foreign oil and gas extraction income (FOGEI) exclusion. We did not model the changes allowing carryforward of GILTI foreign tax credits (FTCs) and losses, repeal of the high-tax exemption for subpart F, or the tax increases on dual capacity taxpayers.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Read and watch Kamala Harris' full concession speech - NBC Washington,"Vice President Kamala Harris officially conceded the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump in a speech Wednesday afternoon. The full remarks she made at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., are below.

So let me say, my heart is full today. My heart is full today. Full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country and full of resolve.

The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say, hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.

To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials, I thank you. I thank you all.

Look, I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it, and the way we ran it. Over the one-hundred-and-seven days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions. Bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.

Now I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.

A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.

At the same time in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.

I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do.

We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.

And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways. In how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect. By looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor. By always using our strength to lift people up. To fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work, but like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work, hard work can be joyful work and the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it.

To the young people who are watching, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's gonna be OK. On the campaign I would often say, when we fight we win. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win.

The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up, don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power and don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before. You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world and so to everyone who is watching: Do not despair.

This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.

Look many of you know I started out as a prosecutor, and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives. People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge.

And I'll close with this. There's an adage an historian once called a law of history true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all I hope that is not the case.

But here's the thing. America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars. The light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service. And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America.

I thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Why did white women and the Democratic base abandon Kamala Harris? My view from the campaign trail - The Conversation,"On the Saturday before Election Day, I travelled from Washington DC to Charlotte, North Carolina, to attend one of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ last campaign rallies.

It was extraordinary how many women were in the crowd – young Black women in particular. There were also older, suburban, white women who looked like they could have been Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren’s sister or cousin.

There were many men, who were just as enthusiastic. But they were far outnumbered by the women.

Harris was warm and charismatic, and the women in the crowd had such a huge reaction to her. They saved their biggest cheers for her lines about reproductive rights – North Carolina has very strict abortion restrictions, which are affecting women across the state.

Overall, though, I got a sense of cautious optimism from the crowd. There was absolutely no complacency. People were very nervous and anxious about the impending election against Donald Trump, especially since North Carolina was one of the seven key battleground states. You could sense a kind of distrust in the broader American electorate.

Cynical decision-making and misogyny

One of the focal points of Harris’ campaign was her outreach to women voters. She made this election about freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health.

And while this message did resonate with many women – in particular younger women – it didn’t with others. According to exit polls by the Associated Press, 47% of women over the age of 45 voted for Trump, as well as 43% of women aged 18-44. More than half of white women overall also voted for Trump (53%).

Exit polls by CNN also found that while Harris did better than Hillary Clinton in 2016 with white women with college degrees, white women without degrees overwhelmingly supported Trump.

This says a lot about the decisions that some women made in the election. It seems possible that what Trump was able to do was give these women enough wiggle room to reconcile what might seem to be otherwise irreconcilable. For instance, they could perhaps believe that Trump wouldn’t actually implement a national abortion ban, simply because he has said he would not. Or they may simply believe that Trump’s policies wouldn’t necessarily apply to them.

I think this led to some potentially cynical decision-making among voters, much as there was in 2016.

And as expected, Harris also did worse than Trump among men. At least some of this - alongside the voting patterns of white women - comes down to structural racism and misogyny and the toxic mix of the two. Trump’s entire campaign was structured around appealing to men and mobilising them to vote, in particular younger men.

There was clearly a level of discomfort among men with the idea of a woman president. And there’ll be a lot of recriminations about Harris’ inability to appeal to those men, even though she had an entire event devoted to “white dudes” and put forth an economic plan specifically for Black men.

I think she did run an effective campaign overall, judging it on the basis of campaign tactics, but the underlying structures and divisions of American politics were hard to overcome. Trump didn’t create these divisions, but he exploits them like no one else can.

This is also partly because the Democrats – even Harris’ campaign – seemed either unwilling or unable to really address these structural divisions, economic inequality and their own role in the greatly changed economy in the US, dating back to the decisions of the Clinton administration in the 1990s.

Where to now for the Democrats?

Harris also had to walk this impossible line in attempting to be the “change candidate” while not disavowing the Biden administration.

There’s been a lot of attention in the US media today about a moment in early October on The View, a popular talk show, in which Harris was asked what she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, if given the chance. And she said nothing came to mind.

It’s entirely possible the Democrats will take the wrong lesson out of this campaign. There are recriminations already coming from the right of the party that Harris had moved too far to the left and should have spent more time trying to appeal to Republican voters in states like Pennsylvania.

But I think you could make the opposite argument – that the Democrats failed to listen to their base in places like Michigan, where there was so much anger for the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war on Gaza. In the Democratic primaries earlier this year, for instance, some 100,000 people in Michigan voted “uncommitted” instead of for Biden.

And when you consider the fact that Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian representative in Congress, was re-elected with a huge majority in Michigan, as was Representative Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, this suggests Harris’ campaign did not mobilise the base in the way that it needed to. They didn’t listen to what the base was telling them.

The Democrats need to look now at offering real structural economic change that addresses inequality and a reassessment of the US role in the world.

They can’t underestimate the appeal of Trump’s line about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, for instance – that this wouldn’t have happened under a Trump presidency. Many Americans are exhausted with American-led wars or American involvement in wars overseas - and I think that’s another thing the Harris campaign and Biden administration were either unable or unwilling to hear that.",Why did white women and the Democratic base abandon Kamala Harris?

Both candidates also visited Pittsburgh. Trump then flew off to North Carolina while Harris made her way to Philadelphia, where the crowd had already gathered hours before.

Mayor Cherelle Parker and Senator Bob Casey kicked it off as people continued to stream in. Parker shared her signature saying, “one Philadelphia,” prompting the crowd to hold up their index fingers. Casey made his last pitch to Pennsylvania voters to keep him in office while also thanking the volunteers for their efforts on behalf of Democrats up and down the ballot.

“At this moment, ll the work that’s been done, all the doors that have been knocked on—more doors than have been knocked on in the history of this state,” he said.”

Lady Gaga, The Roots, and Ricky Martin performed at the event in Philadelphia while Oprah Winfrey, Fat Joe, and Philly’s own DJ Jazzy Jeff delivered speeches. Katy Perry performed via the link to Pittsburgh and Jon Bon Jovi performed Livin on a Prayer from Detroit.

Shortly before the vice president arrived on the “Rocky Steps,” Lady Gaga performed God Bless America before telling the crowd it was up to them to protect women’s rights.

"Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,WATCH: Harris speaks at church in Detroit while Trump calls Democrats ‘demonic’ at his rally - PBS NewsHour,"LITITZ, Pa. (AP) — Kamala Harris told a Michigan church on Sunday that God offers America a “divine plan strong enough to heal division,” while Donald Trump gave a profane and conspiracy-laden speech in which he mused about reporters being shot and labeled Democrats as “demonic.”

Watch Harris’ remarks in the player above.

The two major candidates took starkly different tones on the final Sunday of the campaign. Less than 48 hours before Election Day, Harris, the Democratic vice president, argued that Tuesday’s election offers voters the chance to reject “chaos, fear and hate,” while Trump, the Republican former president, repeated lies about voter fraud to try to cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and suggested that the country was falling apart without him in office.

Harris was concentrating her Sunday in Michigan, beginning the day with a few hundred parishioners at Detroit’s Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ. It marked the fourth consecutive Sunday that Harris, who is Baptist, has spoken to a Black congregation, a reflection of how critical Black voters are across multiple battleground states.

“I see faith in action in remarkable ways,” she said in remarks that quoted the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah. “I see a nation determined to turn the page on hate and division and chart a new way forward. As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states and so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice.”

She never mentioned Trump, though she’s certain to return to her more conventional partisan speech in stops later Sunday. But Harris did tell her friendly audience that “there are those who seek to deepen division, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos.” The election and “this moment in our nation,” she continued, “has to be about so much more than partisan politics. It must be about the good work we can do together.”

Harris finished her remarks in about 11 minutes — starting and ending during Trump’s roughly 90-minute speech at a chilly outdoor rally at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, airport.

Trump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled “the weave.” But in Lancaster, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.

Instead, Trump relaunched criticisms of voting procedures across the nation and his own staff. He resurrected grievances about being prosecuted after trying to overturn his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden, suggesting at one point that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House.

And he intensified his attacks of a “grossly incompetent” national leadership and U.S media, at one point musing about violence against members of the press.

He noted the ballistic glass placed in front of him at events after a gunman nearly assassinated him at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and talked about places where he saw openings.

“I have this piece of glass here,” he said. “But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.”

His campaign later sought to clarify his meaning.

“President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.”

Trump also referred to John Bolton, his former national security adviser and now a strident critic, as a “dumb son of a b—.” And he repeated familiar and debunked theories about voter fraud, alleging that Democrats could only win by cheating. Public polls indicate a tight and competitive race between him and Harris.

“It’s a crooked country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to make it straight. We’re going to make it straight.”

Trump acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach. He repeatedly mentioned how he disregarded the advice of his aides, telling their side of the story in a mocking voice.

Co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, long credited with bringing order to Trump’s often-chaotic political operation, watched the former president silently from off stage.

Trump at one point suggested that he wouldn’t deliver this version of his speech again: “I hope you’ve enjoyed this,” he said, “because I’m only doing this one time.”

"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"As president, Kamala Harris would expand Medicare to cover home care services - afscme","Many AFSCME members work in the care economy – among them child care providers and home care workers. For many years, they have been calling for more affordable child care for families with young children as well as investments in elder care as our country’s population continues to age.

The Biden-Harris administration has taken important steps to address this crisis. The American Rescue Plan, for example, invested $60 billion in the care economy and represented the biggest investment in child care ever. Yet more needs to be done.

That’s why AFSCME strongly supports Vice President Kamala Harris’ plan to expand Medicare to cover home health services for the elderly, which she announced on Tuesday on “The View.”

Her plan is aimed at helping the almost one in four adults – including about half of people in their 40s – who are part of the “sandwich generation.” These are individuals who have an elderly parent at the same time as they are raising a child or providing financial support to an adult child.

“I took care of my mother when she was sick,” Harris said on the show. “She was diagnosed with cancer. So, it is a personal experience for me as well as something I care deeply about.”

Harris’ plan would “cover home care for the first time ever for all of our nation’s seniors and those with disabilities on Medicare who need it, in addition to vision and hearing benefits to help seniors live independently for longer,” according to a fact sheet published by her campaign.

To pay for these new benefits, Harris said, she will expand Medicare drug price negotiations, which have already capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35. Additional money will come from increasing discounts for certain brand-name drugs in Medicare and addressing Medicare fraud.

“It’s about dignity for that individual,” Harris said on the show. “It’s about independence for that individual. People are of declining skills to some extent, but their dignity and their pride has not declined.”

Harris’ plan will help family caregivers stay in the labor force. In addition, by allowing seniors to stay in their homes instead of receiving care in nursing homes, it will save money for both families and the federal government.

By strengthening Medicare to cover home care services, the workers who provide those services will also benefit. “This initiative will provide care workers access to better wages, improve quality of care for seniors and those with disabilities, and treat our seniors with the dignity they deserve,” the Harris campaign said.","As president, Kamala Harris would expand Medicare to cover home care services  afscme",afscme,https://www.afscme.org/blog/as-president-kamala-harris-would-expand-medicare-to-cover-home-care-services
"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,What does Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 election mean for the US? - Al Jazeera English,"Analysts say race and gender played a significant role in Harris’s defeat, but so did voter disillusionment.

Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss in the US presidential election means that she has become the second female candidate to be beaten by Republican Donald Trump, despite mounting a historic campaign.

For the analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera, Harris’s loss brought a sense of deja vu, echoing the defeat of fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

They stressed that Harris’s race and gender played a pivotal role in her defeat at the hands of former President Trump, whose political career has been defined by sexism and racism.

“The biggest underlying dynamic in American politics right now is views toward race, views toward gender,” said Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher focused on gender.

Undem and other experts predict the Democrats will face a tsunami of backlash, given the stakes of the 2024 election.

“Harris and the Democrats are going to face a whole lot of wrath,” Undem explained. “There will be all kinds of narratives: What’s wrong with Democrats? What’s wrong with Harris? Was it her race and gender? She talks about abortion too much…”

As the shock of Harris’s loss settles, Mike Nellis, a former adviser to Harris’s 2020 campaign and a founder of the group White Dudes for Harris, said there will be crucial lessons for the Democratic Party to heed as it faces the battles ahead under President-elect Trump.

“Everybody will have an opinion,” Nellis told Al Jazeera. “All of our hair will be on fire.”

The ‘deep-seatedness of white supremacy’

Had she won, Harris would have shattered glass ceilings and become the first woman, second Black person and first South Asian to be elected to the highest office in the land.

Harris herself made little mention of the historic nature of her presidential bid during her compressed, three-month sprint to Election Day, after President Joe Biden dropped out in July.

Instead, she pitched herself as a candidate for “all Americans”, running a centrist campaign and promising a continuation of Biden’s policies.

Part of that strategy included overtures to Republicans disillusioned with Trump, and she campaigned alongside conservative lawmakers like former US Representative Liz Cheney.

But it wasn’t enough to win her the White House.

“This loss indicates we still have so much more work to do here in the US in terms of sex and race relations,” said Tammy Vigil, a professor at Boston University whose research focuses on women in politics.

Vigil said that Trump has “afforded people the ability to be their worst selves, and that definitely includes being sexist and racist”.

The question of gender and race will continue to be a mobilising force, she added: “It’s going to be a big rallying cry.”

For Nadia Brown, the director of the women’s and gender studies programme at Georgetown University, there is no question that Harris was the better-qualified candidate in the race.

She had decades of government experience under her belt: from her time as a public prosecutor to her service in the Senate and White House.

That raises questions about why so many voters opted for her opponent, Brown explained.

“This loss just underscores the amount of ingrained racism and white hetero-patriarchy, the deep-seatedness of white supremacy in this nation,” Brown said. “You can’t deny that she is someone who could have served as president on day one.”

Trump has repeatedly described Harris as “low IQ” and “mentally disabled”, even calling her “one of the dumber people in the history of our country”.

That kind of rhetoric, Brown said, gave his supporters a licence to dismiss and denigrate Harris. “The way that Trump has painted her and people’s responses to her have just brought out the worst in a lot of folks.”

Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, noted that Harris is not the first presidential candidate to encounter hurdles based on race or gender.

She pointed to former President Barack Obama, the first Black president of the US, who faced repeated questions about his country of birth and whether he was Muslim.

And then there was Clinton, the first female presidential nominee from a major party. During her campaign, Trump supporters rallied under signs that read, “Trump that b****”. Trump himself accused her of “playing the woman’s card”.

While Obama faced challenges with race and Clinton with gender, those hurdles were compounded for Harris, Gillespie told Al Jazeera, adding that the “sexism that Harris faced is racially tinged”.

“All three of them, because of the ways that they were different, experienced challenges,” Gillespie said of Harris, Clinton and Obama.

But Gillespie argued it was “doubly hard for Harris” because of the combined force of misogyny and racism. “Harris experienced them differently because she is both a woman and a person of colour.”

Playing the blame game

But Harris’s loss does not solely come down to questions of race and gender.

Several analysts said the Democratic Party will have to grapple with how effectively it was able to connect with key demographics during this presidential race, including those disenchanted by Harris’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza.

The war had splintered the party in the lead-up to the election, with progressives, Arab Americans and Muslim voters largely opposing the Biden-Harris administration’s continued support of Israel.

Dalia Mogahed, a former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, had warned that Harris’s pro-Israel stance had the potential of costing her the election.

But she emphasised it would be unfair to blame specific demographics for Harris’s loss.

“It’s the candidate that should be earning people’s votes, not feeling entitled to them,” Mogahed said.

Still, she feared that the tendency to assign blame may crop up now that Harris has been defeated. When Trump was first elected in 2016, there was a lot of “liberal sympathy” for Muslim and Arab people who were seen as victims of his policies, Mogahed said.

Trump implemented what critics called a “Muslim ban” in 2017, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries.

But given the large Arab American and Muslim backlash to Harris’s support for Israel, that same sympathy might not be present this time around, Mogahed warned.

“Muslims might feel very isolated in a second Trump presidency,” she said. “And it’s going to be a very difficult four years for anyone who is advocating on behalf of the humanity of Palestinians.”

For Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida, Harris’s defeat highlights the Democratic Party’s failures to connect with key elements of its base.

“The Democratic Party continues to fail in listening to their voters,” Mubarak said, citing the party’s support for Israel as well as its lack of engagement with under-resourced communities.

She pointed out that, while Trump also boasts pro-Israel policies, Democrats like Harris had an opportunity to take action to alleviate the humanitarian concerns raised by Israel’s war. But they did not.

“They had the power to place an arms embargo but instead chose to continue to fund and endorse Israel’s genocide, and now it is the people in this country that will continue to suffer,” Mubarak explained.

“But the people have spoken, and this is a message that they will no longer continue to vote for a cleaner dirty shirt.”

Nellis, the former Harris adviser, stressed that, to be successful in future presidential races, Democrats must ask themselves, “What are the things about us that we can change?”

The condensed nature of Harris’s campaign did not help, Nellis said, but Democrats need to think about the voters they left behind. That includes demographics commonly associated with the Republican Party.

“I want to have a serious conversation about how we’re talking to and trying to bring back non-college-educated white men. I want to talk about rural voters. I want to talk about going into hostile spaces and trying to win folks back,” he said.

Most urgently, he added, “We need to be mobilising to fight back and try to stop some of the worst things that Trump is going to want to do.”

What happens now?

With Harris defeated, Brown, the Georgetown University professor, predicts the US will not see the groundswell of protest that greeted Trump’s first win in 2016.

In 2017, the day after Trump was inaugurated, thousands of women flooded the streets in Washington, DC, and other cities with pink hats and feminist slogans. Activists around the country organised anti-Trump “resistance” campaigns.

Brown said that there may be some protests this year, though likely not to that scale.

“I’ve been doing focus groups with Black women who are the most reliable Democratic voters, and what they’re sharing is that they are just exhausted. They are fatigued. They are burned out,” said Brown.

Protesting Trump, she added, has become “less safe”. More than 180 people, for example, were arrested for protesting Trump’s inauguration, and some were charged with felony rioting — though many of those charges were later dropped.

But Trump has promised vengeance against critics and opponents, and many fear that the repression of dissent will be far harsher this time around.

“There are going to be some people who will figure out ways to resist,” Gillespie at Emory University said. “The big question is, how will Trump respond? Does he respond with repression?”

Vigil of Boston University pointed to recent decisions by two leading national newspapers to cancel their Harris endorsements as evidence that even the powerful fear a Trump backlash.

“Unfortunately there is a fear that has become [almost] pervasive among business owners, among reporters, among everyday people,” Vigil said.

Trump, she noted, has called his domestic adversaries “the enemy within” — and threatened military intervention against them.

“All that speaks to the motion towards fascism that Harris was right about,” Vigil said. That, in turn, threatens to dampen any protest.

"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,The End of Kamala Harris’s Campaign - The New Yorker,"At nearly every Harris rally I attended, whether at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago or at an arena in Savannah, Georgia, a lone protester would stand up in the middle of Harris’s speech and call for an end to American support of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The unease of the crowd every time this happened was palpable. (In Kalamazoo, the audience started booing over a protester. Two men in suits, evidently security, rushed up the steps from the floor of the arena where the protester was standing, held campaign signs up over him as if he could be camouflaged, and led him out.) Harris would typically respond by saying something along the lines of “We need to end this war and bring the hostages home,” which only served as a reminder that the Biden-Harris Administration had not managed to do so. Regardless of the extent to which this mattered electorally, it mattered in the rooms in which Harris spoke, where her supporters were asked to ignore the dissonance between the ideals of freedom and democracy in her speeches and the reality on the ground in Gaza.

As Harris made a bid to appeal to the center, there were many moments in the campaign that rang hollow: when she said, while representing the Party that has aimed to present itself as a leader on climate change and gun safety, that she would not ban fracking, or asserted that she kept a Glock, telling Oprah that “if somebody breaks in my house, they’re getting shot.” Then there were her appearances with the anti-Trump Republican and former congresswoman Liz Cheney and the pride with which Harris received the endorsement of her father, the Republican former Vice-President Dick Cheney, one of the architects of the Iraq War.

As the campaign came to a close, celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Tyler Perry lined up to endorse Harris. But in an election that was probably decided on the sense of precarity experienced by many Americans—that a stable career, a secure home, and affordable child care are increasingly elusive; that financial ruin is an accident or illness away—these famous figures did not help the Party reassure a wide swath of voters that it understood what they cared about and needed to hear.

At Howard, as we waited to hear Harris’s concession speech, I asked a few people what they thought the campaign should have done differently. “I’ve been door-knocking since I was seventeen,” Joanna Blotner told me. “Since 2010, there is a consistent message of just not feeling like votes matter, like anything that happens in Congress or in D.C. has an impact…. So when you talk about democracy being on the line, there’s no resonance. They don’t see democracy working.”",The End of Kamala Harris’s Campaign  The New Yorker,The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-end-of-kamala-harriss-campaign

Long before they even knew what the White House was... Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are pictured above both aged three. Decades apart, Democratic presidential nominee Harris spent her early years in Oakland, California, and Republican nominee Trump was raised in the New York borough of Queens.

Harris (left in the left-hand image below) and her sister Maya (centre) were primarily brought up by their Indian mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and social activist. Trump's father Fred Trump was the son of German immigrants and his mother Mary Anne MacLeod Trump was born in Scotland. They enrolled him in the New York Military Academy at age 13.

Harris spent five years at high school in Montreal, Canada, where her mother took up a teaching job at McGill University. She later enrolled in the historically black college, Howard University in Washington DC.

Trump has said his five years at the academy, which began in 1959, gave him military training and helped shape his leadership skills. He later sat out the Vietnam War due to deferments - four for academic reasons and one due to bone spurs.

From an early age, Harris was taught by her mother the importance of the civil rights movement and she attended the annual Martin Luther King Jr Freedom March in Washington in 2004. After earning a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Trump became favoured to succeed his father at the helm of the family business.

Harris returned to California, where she rose swiftly to the top of the state's criminal justice system - taking a job as its attorney general - and used that momentum to mount a successful run for the US Senate in 2016.

At the same time as she entered Congress, Trump was stepping into the White House for the first time, having stunned the world to defeat Hillary Clinton. Three years later Harris ran a lacklustre presidential campaign, but was picked by the victor of the Democratic race, Joe Biden, to be his running mate. They proved to be the winning ticket, defeating Trump and Mike Pence.

The end of the Trump presidency and the start of the Biden-Harris term were marked by Covid lockdowns, mask mandates and social unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Harris struggled at times to make her mark as vice-president, but found her voice in 2022 when the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion. President Biden was happy for her to become the White House champion for the pro-choice movement. It was Trump who had made the Supreme Court more conservative, paving the way for the abortion ruling. During his time in the Oval Office, he also took the US out of the Paris climate accord and took steps to reduce immigration.

Harris's debut international visit as vice-president was to Guatemala in 2021, as part of the responsibility she was given to reduce the numbers of Latin American migrants reaching America's southern border with Mexico. Foreign policy issues that have dominated her time in office include the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump's first visit overseas as president was to Saudi Arabia in 2017. Trump advocates isolationist policies that involve disentangling his country from foreign conflicts and promoting American industry.

Harris is married to Doug Emhoff (pictured below), who campaigns regularly on her behalf. She is stepmother - or ""Momala"", as she says - to Emhoff's children from his first marriage, Cole (left) and Ella (right). Various members of Donald Trump's family have played roles in his political career, though appearances in the 2024 campaign by his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump, have been limited. With his first wife, Ivana, Trump had three children: Donald Jr (second left in the lower picture), Ivanka (second right) and Eric (right). He had a daughter, Tiffany (left), with his second wife, Marla Maples. He married his third wife Melania (third left) in 2005, with whom he has one son, Barron.

Harris entered the 2024 presidential race relatively late in the process, replacing Joe Biden who pulled out. She made history as the first black and Asian-American woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket, and went on to give a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- From San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general, U.S. senator, and now the first Black and Asian woman to be nominated for president, Kamala Harris has a history of breaking barriers.

Kamala Harris was born in 1964 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland to immigrant parents Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan.

RELATED: How to pronounce Kamala Harris' name and what it means

Donald immigrated from Jamaica and Shyamala from India. The two met at the University of California Berkeley protesting during the Civil Rights Movement.

Harris' only sibling, Maya, was born three years after she was. Their parents separated a couple of years after Maya's birth.

Maya Harris is also an attorney and would go on to have a major influence on Kamala's life and political career.

Long before entering politics, Harris' early childhood in Berkeley gave her an opportunity to be an agent of change when she was bussed across town to be part of the second class to integrate her public school, Thousand Oaks Elementary School.

Harris would spend her early childhood on the border of Berkeley and Oakland. In middle school, when Kamala was 12, her mother moved the family to Montreal, Canada, as she accepted a teaching position at a university.

Harris vowed that she'll ""never give up the fight for a future ... where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body.""

She would finish middle and high school in Montreal visiting the Bay Area for summer breaks and holidays.

In the early '80s, Harris moved back to the States and took her first lap around Washington, D.C., studying economics and political science at Howard University.

Howard is often referred to as ""The Mecca,"" signifying its place as one of the most illustrious Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in the country.

At Howard, Harris would run for office for the first time as freshmen class representative and pledge the Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) sorority.

She graduated in 1986 from the College of Arts & Sciences. Harris then returned to San Francisco to attend law school at the University of California Law San Francisco (formerly UC Hastings).

By the 1990s, Harris become a deputy district attorney for Alameda County, working for the people in her hometown.

Harris first ran for public office as San Francisco District Attorney in 2002, defeating her former boss to become the first Black woman to serve as district attorney in California. Harris is biracial, identifying as both Black and Indian.

Her work in the Bay Area inspired future leaders, including current San Francisco Mayor London Breed.

""She's been a mentor, but she's more like a mother,"" says San Francisco Mayor London Breed. ""I think the name 'Momala' is so perfect for her because she provides you with advice and support, but she also tries to find out what is going on with you and are you taking care of yourself.""'

During her time as San Francisco district attorney, Harris focused on criminal justice reform by being ""smart on crime."" She worked to reduce recidivism by offering job training and education to first-time, non-violent offenders.

She would take a controversial stance by declining to seek the death penalty for the man convicted of killing San Francisco Police Officer Isaac Espinoza.

Harris' next stop on her road to the White House would be at the California State Capitol as the first Black person, first woman and first Asian American to serve as California attorney general from 2011 to 2017.

During her time as attorney general, she led efforts to hold banks accountable for the housing foreclosure crisis, winning $20 billion in a settlement for homeowners in California.

From there, she filled the Senate seat long held by Barbara Boxer and became the second Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate.

Harris would gain national attention during her tenure in the Senate for grilling members of Donald Trump's cabinet, like Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

After just a couple of years in the Senate, Harris would announce her first run for President of the United Stated on ""Good Morning America.""

Harris had a strong run in the early laps of the most crowded field of Democratic presidential hopefuls in history, but she soon ran out of money and ended her bid before the Iowa Caucuses.

Joe Biden would go on to win the presidential nomination for Democrats, and Biden would tap Harris to be his running mate.

With her groundbreaking vice-presidential win, Harris is inspiring another generation, especially young people from Oakland, where she was born.

""It's really an inspiration knowing that she was born in Oakland, and like she was around the same streets,"" explains 14-year-old Anevay Cruz. ""It's really inspiring for the community.""

""She's representing, you know, all the young Black and Indian girls,"" says Harris' former campaign manager Debbie Mesloh. ""She's representing so many women that look at her on that debate stage and say, 'Wow, there she is.'""

On Jan. 20, 2021, Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice president of the United States, making history as the first woman, Black, and Southeast Asian American to hold the position -- with her husband, Doug Emhoff, by her side as the first Second Gentleman.

Her inauguration came just two weeks after the Jan. 6 insurrection, a stark reminder of the polarized state of American politics.

As vice president, Harris was tasked with addressing critical issues, including immigration reform, specifically working to address the root causes of migration from Central America.

In a landmark decision during her tenure, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling nearly 50 years of abortion rights. Harris vocally opposed the ruling and emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights.

Throughout her term, Harris also played a crucial role in passing key legislation, casting tie-breaking Senate votes on major initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at reducing prescription drug costs. However, as the vice president, much of the credit for these achievements went to President Biden.

As the 2024 presidential race heated up, President Biden faced increasing pressure within his own party to step aside, amid growing concerns about his age and capacity to lead for another four years.

On a Sunday morning in July, Biden made the historic decision to withdraw from the race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket. The announcement was met with swift support from Democratic leaders, who unified around Harris.

VIDEO: Biden talks about passing torch in address

President Joe Biden, in a rare Oval Office address to the nation, spoke extensively for the first time on his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race.

With Harris now at the top of the ticket, the stage was set for a high-stakes showdown with former President Donald Trump, who was running for a third time.

Despite heightened excitement surrounding Harris' candidacy during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, she could not overcome some voters' concerns about how her presidency would differ from her predecessor's.

Harris would go on to lose both the popular vote and the electoral college. She delivered her concession speech from her alma mater of Howard University.

""While I conceded this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation -- the ideals that reflect America at its best. That is a fight I will never give up,"" she said.

While I conceded this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. Kamala Harris

""May that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. May God bless you. And may God Bless the United States of America,"" she continued.

Throughout her first presidential run, her selection as vice president, her tenure as vice president, and throughout her second run for president, ABC7 spoke with those who surrounded Harris throughout her journey to answer the question: Who is Kamala Harris?

""Kamala Harris: An Historic Campaign,"" a new ABC7 documentary, details Harris' journey from her childhood in the Bay Area to her formative years at Howard University and then her rise to political prominence in San Francisco, the state of California, the U.S. Senate, the Vice Presidency, and her journey as the first woman of color to top a major party ticket.

Childhood friends, colleagues, mentors and young people she's inspired discuss Harris' rise to the vice presidency and her impact for generations to come.

"Sun, 13 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Kamala Harris’s Hundred-Day Campaign - The New Yorker,"When Joe Biden called Kamala Harris on the morning of Sunday, July 21st, she was in the kitchen at the Vice-President’s residence, a turreted mansion on a hill in Northwest Washington. Harris was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, was in Los Angeles, but the house was bustling with relatives. She had just finished making bacon and pancakes for two grandnieces before sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle.

Biden was calling from isolation, both literal and political; he had spent the previous night socially distanced at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, recovering from COVID and absorbing the reality that he had lost the confidence of the Democratic Party. Twenty-four days earlier, Biden’s addled performance in a televised debate with Donald Trump had sparked a frantic effort to replace him at the top of the ticket. On the phone, Biden told Harris that he was ending his bid for reëlection. More to the point, he said that he would be endorsing her as the Presidential nominee.

Harris was grateful—though it wasn’t clear that Biden’s support would suffice. Last year, one poll found that she had the lowest approval rating of any Vice-President since its records began. At least half a dozen other prominent Democrats—including Cabinet members and the governors of Michigan and Pennsylvania—were seen as potentially stronger contenders. During the uncertain weeks when Biden was deliberating over whether to drop out, strategists and pundits had imagined selecting a candidate through some kind of primarylike contest—composed, perhaps, of town halls and an open convention. One typical proposal warned that handing Harris the nomination without a fight would “set her and the Party up to fail.” But Harris was accustomed to facing resistance. At an event in D.C. last spring, she told the audience, “Sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open. Sometimes they won’t. And then you need to kick that fucking door down.”

By the time Biden announced his withdrawal, that Sunday afternoon, a scramble was already under way, largely out of public view. Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative who helped Harris secure the nomination, told me that her team saw value in moving swiftly. “We weren’t going to do this bullshit that other people were asking for,” he said. In his view, an open convention was a way to “skip over Kamala.”

After Biden’s call, Harris had summoned aides to her house, and a dozen or so people gathered around a table. She sat beside Tony West, her brother-in-law and unofficial consigliere, who had served as the third-ranking official in Obama’s Justice Department. In the hours that followed, her team undertook an operation that was less an improvisation than a culmination of years spent cultivating allies, including some forty-seven hundred delegates to the Democratic National Convention.

Ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, in 2022, Harris’s staff had been taking greater pains to plan and track her encounters around the country—photo lines, meet and greets, and other occasions of well-managed access—with an eye toward soliciting help to mount a campaign in 2028. Now, on a radically truncated schedule, they opened spreadsheets and started making calls. Harris took the biggest names: Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the top Democrats in the House and Senate, and the heads of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and the Progressive Caucus. She talked to the leaders of major unions and to advocates for abortion rights, the environment, and gun safety. She also called potential opponents—Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, and a handful of others. Several asked her a version of the same question: “Do you think there should be some kind of process?” Harris said that she was open to it but added, pointedly, that she was already seeking pledges from delegates. In other words, good luck with your town halls.

Not everyone signed on to her candidacy right away. Obama released a statement voicing confidence in “a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.” The former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Biden—while conspicuously saying nothing about a successor. But, around the country, activists who favored Harris were coördinating. Mini Timmaraju, a delegate to the Convention and the head of the abortion-rights group Reproductive Freedom for All, told me, “My phone was ringing off the hook from people, like, ‘Women of color, we’ve got to stand together for Vice-President Harris. If they don’t consolidate around the Vice-President, we’re going to create trouble.’ ” Harris called Timmaraju from her table to ask her to pledge support. “I was so excited, I was, like, ‘Yes! Hell yes,’ ” Timmaraju recalled. Then, realizing that she had just shouted at the Vice-President, she added, “I’m sorry I yelled at you, Ma’am.”

By 10 P.M., the table was littered with half-eaten pizza and salad, and Harris had called more than a hundred people. Several Democrats who might have challenged her, including Whitmer, Shapiro, and Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona, had promised their support. Aides estimated that they’d have pledges from a majority of Convention delegates within forty-eight hours. Harris was on track to be the first Democratic nominee since Hubert Humphrey, back in 1968, to secure the nomination without winning a primary. As Sellers put it, “We ended up having an open convention. It was just the shortest open convention in the history of mankind.” Harris never had time to change out of her sweats.

By the following morning, with a hundred and six days until the election, she had endorsements from a majority of Democrats in Congress, two large unions, and a growing number of state delegations. Some worried that the choice was hasty. Mike Murphy, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, tweeted, “Dems would be well advised to slow down and think this through.” The Atlantic ran an essay by Graeme Wood titled “Democrats Are Making a Huge Mistake.” The Washington Post columnist Perry Bacon told colleagues, “To be totally honest here, my worry is that it seems like Trump is likely to win.” But Harris’s allies in Washington believed that she was being underestimated, just as many of them had been. “There’s a whole universe of us in this town that nobody saw,” Timmaraju told me. “For so long, our interactions and engagements just weren’t considered relevant for political prognosticators.” She added, “Look who organized and mobilized within twenty-four hours!”

David Axelrod, who was the chief strategist for both of Obama’s Presidential campaigns, told me, “There was an argument that she would be strengthened by a competition, but she showed a mastery of the internal politics, which is one test of a potential candidate. People respond to competence, and that was a very competent operation.” He compared it to a rapid military strike. “She didn’t get handed this nomination,” he said. “She took it.”

In two days, Harris signed up more than fifty thousand volunteers. On CNN, the commentator Van Jones said, “You can do your whole career and not get fifty thousand volunteers.” By the following Monday, the number had reached three hundred and sixty thousand. There was a cascade of fund-raising video calls, organized by demographic, starting with #WinWithBlackWomen. The one arranged for white women—“Karens for Kamala,” as one organizer joked—broke the record for history’s biggest Zoom. In Florida, at the Villages, a retirement community known as a pro-Trump stronghold, Harris supporters staged a parade that an organizer on the scene solemnly called the “largest golf cart caravan for a Democratic candidate in nearly a decade.”

Harris’s sudden arrival at the forefront of American politics summoned the prospect that, as John F. Kennedy put it in 1961, the “torch has been passed to a new generation.” But it also evoked a less often cited part of Kennedy’s formulation—his description of Americans as “tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.” In the past eight years, Democrats, like the rest of the country, have witnessed too much tumult—Trump, Charlottesville, COVID, George Floyd, January 6th, the end of Roe—to expect easy success.

Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law professor and historian, watched the surge of enthusiasm and was reminded of the power of contingency—the politically crucial alchemy of timing, biography, and context. She told me, “The electorate was perfectly positioned to accept an individual who could be portrayed as a harbinger of the new when lots of people were feeling stuck, as if our politics would be nothing but unbridled nastiness from now on.”

Yet Harris treated the moment gingerly. Unlike Obama, she did not give a big speech on race; unlike Hillary Clinton, she didn’t dress in the white of Seneca Falls. Since Clinton ran in 2016, the number of female governors has doubled; some six hundred more women now sit in state legislatures. Harris, though, trod so carefully on matters of identity that at times one could lose sight of the fact that a woman descended from Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and married to a Jewish man, was being regarded as a plausible candidate for the Presidency. “Harris doesn’t emphasize it, but her appearance alone carries the message,” Gordon-Reed said. “Something has changed in this country when a person like her can be in this position. That is inspiring to many people. Of course, to a substantial segment of the population, it is alarming. And we see where the alarm about having had a Black President has taken us.”",Kamala Harris’s Hundred-Day Campaign  The New Yorker,The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/21/kamala-harris-ascent

Harris pledged to continue fighting for women’s rights and against gun violence and to “fight for the dignity that all people deserve”.

She said she had called President-elect Trump, congratulated him on his triumph and promised to engage in a peaceful transfer of power.

In the final stretch of the 2024 presidential race, one person seems notably absent from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign: President Joe Biden. Since ending his reelection bid in July, Biden has largely stayed off the campaign trail, leaving Harris to carve out her own path and focus on distinguishing herself from the sitting president’s record.

She has dropped all references to “Bidenomics” from her campaign speeches, a term which she and Biden’s administration used to refer to its agenda of investing in domestic manufacturing, infrastructure and clean energy. In its place, Harris has pivoted to what she calls the “opportunity economy,” her plan to grow the middle class through tax cuts, a $6,000 child tax credit for new parents, assistance for first-time homebuyers and tax deductions for new small business startups, among other plans.

For the majority of Penn undergraduate students, this upcoming presidential election is the first one in which they’ll be eligible to vote. We didn’t have a say in electing Donald Trump eight years ago, but we dealt — and grew up — with the consequences of his policies.

With the dire threat of another Trump presidency, the nation needs Vice President Kamala Harris. That is why The Daily Pennsylvanian Editorial Board is endorsing Harris for president.

Harris offers a vision of stability and opportunity for all Americans, and her proposed policies reflect that commitment. Her economic plan to lower costs for middle-class families will remove barriers to access of everyday necessities, like healthcare, housing, and groceries. She promises to prioritize workers and small business owners in the interest of creating jobs, revitalizing communities, and propelling innovation.

In stark contrast, Trump’s economic agenda includes extending tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy and imposing tariffs that place the burden of higher prices on American consumers. As many Penn students prepare to join the labor force after graduation, issues like the rising cost of living, inflation, and student loan repayment are top of mind. Trump’s fiscal policies threaten financial security and access to opportunities, for us and our fellow Americans.

Beyond the economy, Americans’ fundamental freedoms are also on the line. Trump praises himself for picking the United States Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, which caused millions of women to lose their right to an abortion and to make decisions about their own bodies. Harris’ promise to sign a federal law restoring our reproductive freedoms demonstrates her commitment to defending our constitutional rights as president.

Her policies not only align with the issues young voters care about most, as reflected in a recent survey of over 900 Penn undergraduates conducted by the DP, but they cater to what the United States needs right now.

However, mere days away from the election, the assurance of a Harris presidency has yet to materialize. National polls show a neck-and-neck race to the finish, tied at 48% between Harris and Trump. The Editorial Board recognizes that some voters are still not thrilled or convinced by all of Harris’ stances, but in this election, we are faced with more than a decision about policies. For the alternative candidate, acting in self-interest is all that he cares about.

Trump cannot be persuaded away from his bigoted and authoritarian tendencies, which have prompted bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio and an insurrection in our Capitol building. In May, he was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records during his 2016 presidential campaign.

The rhetoric of his campaign is defined by hate and prejudice against marginalized communities. Just this Sunday, speakers at a Trump rally in New York City exemplified the messaging of his political movement: racist comments, later labeled as “jokes,” targeting groups across various races, ethnicities and religions. This constant divisiveness and intolerance is unacceptable.

By contrast, Harris has demonstrated empathy and a humanity that is embodied by her middle-class upbringing with immigrant parents who fought for fundamental freedoms. She is the choice who will protect American democracy rather than gamble with it. A vote for her is a vote for leadership rooted in integrity.

In this pivotal election, let’s also not lose sight of the privilege of being in a state where our vote truly matters. Philadelphia and Pennsylvania are at the forefront of the national stage. In just the past week — and not to mention throughout the entire semester — political campaign activity and celebrity appearances on campus have been rampant. The gravity of this situation is palpable and remarkably undeniable. We, the students of Penn, have the power to meet this moment on Nov. 5.

As the newest group of voters in the United States, we now have the chance to prevent an outcome we couldn’t control in 2016. Let’s make the right choice, Penn.

I graduated from Penn in May 2023 with a chemical engineering degree. I grew up in Lower Merion Township, where I voted a few months after becoming a United States citizen in 2021, and again in 2022 and 2023. I now work in Houston for an oil and gas company where I design low-carbon hydrogen production plants. In a twist of fate, I will be voting in Harris County (literally, that's the name of the county) this year. I want to discuss my perspective on the election and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign strategy.

My message to the Penn community is to consider what I say here. If you agree, share this article so that the Harris campaign may understand a commonly held point of view. If you disagree, express your thoughts, perhaps by writing an article like this one, explaining what you think Harris will do, and how that aligns with the future you would like to see. Also ask yourself, does what you like about Harris align with the interests of enough voters to assemble a winning coalition? Make your voice heard, because in a tight race like this, every opinion, and every vote, counts. Please vote for what you think is right for you, your family, and the country.

I read all 82 pages of the Vice President's policy statement after watching her Oct. 16 Fox News appearance. I was frustrated by her lack of policy discussions, but in the waning moments of the interview, Harris told me to visit her website if that is what I was looking for. I was, so I did. My assessment is that this document is a win for the U.S. It expounds on the Biden-Harris administration's positive accomplishments, and it is clear and detailed about what happened in the last 45 months. However, when it comes to the plans of the future Harris presidency, it is light on specific details.

As a practicing engineer, the most interesting section for me is “Chapter 9: Invest in American Innovation and Industrial Strength Powered by American Workers.” Chapter 9 extols the impressive progress stimulated by Biden's signature legislative accomplishment: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA, along with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, is the solution Biden had for the problems facing hollowed-out, working communities after 40 years of devastating neoliberal policies. He seized an opportunity to establish a large-scale industrial policy that utilizes America’s global advantage in research, development, and design of cutting edge technology to revitalize American industry.

In a brilliant maneuver, Biden coupled the generation of job opportunities along the entire value chain, from working-class operators and technicians to professional engineers and researchers, with a win for sustainability activists by advancing humanity’s ability to produce, manipulate, and consume energy. Some voted to limit the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide to 419.3 parts per million, while others voted for a piece of American prosperity. In all cases, Biden delivered. I would know. Employed in the clean energy sector, I am one of the many Americans who has benefited from this action. But what is most crucial is that working Americans in industrial states like Pennsylvania are the ones that most needed this win. And they got it. They are also the voters responsible for granting Democrats the opportunity to govern. I know that most Penn students are not accustomed to thinking about this political faction, but understanding their interests is essential. Once again, these are the key demographic, and once again, they are caught between former President and 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump and a Democrat.

Chapter 9 is but one example of many positive accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration that Harris is promising to expand. Except that she isn’t. Harris never talks about these accomplishments in her public appearances. This is perilous because we are facing the prospect that some people who voted for Biden in 2020, will instead vote for Trump in 2024. Yes, people may have voted for Harris to be vice president, but no one voted for her to be president. At my childhood home in Lower Merion, I know several Pennsylvania voters who are seriously conflicted about their upcoming decision. The way some of my family, friends, and acquaintances see it: Biden was a great president. They were ready to vote for him, and they are ready to vote for Harris if she can show that she will continue Biden’s policies. But this is not what they see. They see Biden kicked out like a dog by opportunistic Democrats. If replacing Biden was really about his tragic frailty and senility, then the vice president running in his stead should be focused on extending his legacy. I want Harris to embrace the accomplishments of her partnership with Biden, protect Lina Khan, and make it clear that she intends to maintain the course on federal agencies. But she is failing. Every time I hear her articulate policy, I am disappointed.

On the other hand, Trump is crystal-clear about his vision. He promises to put hard-working Americans first by curtailing the immigration that depresses wages and sticking to his tariff proposal, because it will incentivize more plants to be built in the U.S., despite the so-called experts rejecting it as mathematically wrong. Whatever you think of his proposed policies and his record, his clear message is working wonders.

I hand this back to you, The Daily Pennsylvanian reader: do you believe that Harris will pivot significantly from the Biden administration? In what way, and is that what you want? If you do not know how to answer that question, do you really want to reward this ad hoc campaign that Democrats are running? Is punishing Trump for his repugnant comments and actions leading up to and on Jan. 6 enough for you? If it is, will it be enough, for enough voters, to win the election?

Harris is making a big mistake focusing on blaming Trump in her public and media appearances. If she spent more time describing her policies, she would have a better chance. Everyone knows Trump's problems; she is wasting energy reminding people. Trump currently leads Pennsylvania in average polling by 0.5 points. Four years ago, Biden led by 1.2 points. Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by 80,555 votes. Trump won in 2016 by 44,292 votes. Meanwhile, in the Pennsylvania senate race, Bob Casey leads David McCormick by 1.4 points. Why the discrepancy? There are going to be voters who will bubble in Casey on their ballot, then look up at the presidential race, and bubble in Trump. We face the most likely outcome: Trump wins Pennsylvania, Casey wins re-election, and Biden gets to say “I told you so … ”

It seems that Harris’ strategy is to flip Trump voters by simultaneously distancing herself from Biden and Trump. Again, it's a big mistake. She takes too seriously the talking point that Biden “destroyed” the economy via inflation. She needs to be proud of what she accomplished with him and stand for Biden's vision. That's what a leader does: do the right thing when it seems like everyone is telling you otherwise.

Harris: Election outcome 'not what we fought for'

Defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has urged her supporters to accept Donald Trump's White House victory, while telling them to ""never give up"" fighting for their ideals. At a concession speech in Washington DC, the US vice-president acknowledged ""the outcome of this election is not what we wanted"", but insisted there must be a peaceful transfer of power. Harris, who cancelled a victory speech that had been planned at the same venue one night earlier, also told the crowd not to despair. Trump has won enough key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin, to secure the presidency, with several states left to declare.

Harris said in Wednesday's remarks from her alma mater, Howard University: ""Hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright. As long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting."" She took the stage to her campaign song Freedom by Beyoncé before thanking her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her campaign staff, supporters, poll workers and election officials. Many in the audience wiped away tears during her remarks. ""I know folks are experiencing a range of emotions right now,"" she said with a chuckle. ""I get it. But we must respect the results of this election.""

Her supporters responded with loud boos when she noted that she had had a phone call with President-elect Trump, and ""I told him we will help him and his team with his transition. And we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power."" ""While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign,"" she added. Her speech referenced ""fight"" or ""fighting"" 19 times. During the campaign the rivals often traded insults, with Harris calling Trump a ""fascist"" and a threat to American democracy. Harris told her supporters on Wednesday: ""I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. But for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case."" The former California senator was running to become the first woman, black woman and South-Asian American to win the presidency.

Harris and Trump spoke by phone on Wednesday, and discussed ""the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans"", a Harris aide told journalists. A spokesman for Trump said that on the call, the president-elect ""acknowledged Vice-President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country"". In a separate call with Biden, the president ""congratulated the Vice-President on her historic campaign"", according to a White House readout of the call. Biden watched Harris's speech live at the White House, one of his aides said. One Harris supporter, Charles Collins, flew in from San Francisco to be at Howard University on Wednesday. ""I'm moving through the process of grief,"" he told the BBC. ""But Kamala asked us to heal, so we can get to work.""

The crowd at Howard University was noticeably smaller than it was on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere was sombre. Many supporters wore black, instead of the bright pink colours of Harris’s sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. “I feel pretty hopeless right now,” said Howard law student Najah Lorde. “I think a lot of us are lost right now."" A young woman who declined to give her name, saying she could not speak to media as an employee of the federal government, told the BBC: “I cannot grapple with the fact that people have put economics over my body, over my rights. “I really am at a loss.”

US voters on one reason Trump won... and why Harris lost

Exit poll data suggests that the Democratic nominee may have under-performed with women. Some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, below the 57% of women Joe Biden won in 2020. Black and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, exit poll data suggested. The campaign faced criticism at times for its failure to expand on a clear economic message, an issue which was extremely important to Americans who have faced several years of rising inflation.

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Kamala Harris has conceded the election to Donald Trump in a private phone call - Fortune,"Kamala Harris called President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to concede the election and congratulate him on his victory, according to a senior adviser to the vice president.

The aide, who declined to be identified discussing a private conversation, said Harris talked about the need for a peaceful transfer of power.

Harris, once viewed as a potential savior for the Democratic Party after Joe Biden ‘s reelection campaign stalled, is reckoning with a profound rejection by American voters in this year’s presidential election.

She trailed in every battleground state to Donald Trump, a man she described as an existential danger to the country’s foundational institutions. And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House — even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss.

Harris planned to deliver a concession speech Wednesday at 4 p.m., her office announced. She’ll speak at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, where her supporters watched returns Tuesday night before being sent home after midnight as Trump pulled ahead in battleground states.

In a bitter footnote for Harris, as the sitting vice president she is expected to oversee Congress’ ceremonial certification of the election.

It’s the same role that Mike Pence played four years ago, when Trump directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol. Although critics said the violent insurrection crystallized Trump’s threat to American democracy, that ultimately did not dissuade voters from electing him again.

Harris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86 years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump.

He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy.

It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed “the female Barack Obama.” Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.

Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party’s future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House’s leading advocate for abortion rights.

Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road.

The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden’s departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention.

Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket.

But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden’s political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change.

Although Harris pitched “a new way forward,” she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary.

Next week, US voters will go to the polls to elect a new president, along with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This election will take place at a time of extreme uncertainty, both for the United States and for the world. The two candidates, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, represent vastly different views of the challenges and opportunities that the country faces, and the role of the United States on the international stage.

The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?

Like all elections, the 5 November vote is about much more than science. However, the fate of scientific research, evidence-based lawmaking and the government’s receptiveness to independent science-policy advice will be key determinants of the country’s future course and long-term well-being. And, as we reported in a News Feature on 23 October (Nature 634, 770–774; 2024), US science could be at an inflection point: the election and a range of domestic and global forces could challenge the primacy that the country has held since the Second World War.

A priority for both the winning presidential candidate and the new members of Congress must be ensuring that US science continues to thrive. This is essential if the world is to solve shared challenges, such as the climate crisis, inequality and societal divisions — and that means retaining the openness and collaborative spirit that have characterized US science for much of the past 75 years. US scientists work with peers around the world, which has helped to position the country at the centre of fundamental, applied and translational research, while creating bonds of friendship and collegiality between US researchers and their international collaborators. These bonds are needed now more than ever.

Power and responsibility

The United States needs leaders who fully understand the responsibilities that come with power and, moreover, are wholeheartedly committed to respecting facts or the consensus of evidence while governing.

Harris, the vice-president under President Joe Biden, is a former US senator; before that, she was a public prosecutor and attorney general in California. In her previous and current roles, she has broadly sought to advance policies that are in line with the scientific consensus and with the objective of keeping people safe and protecting public health and the environment.

What Kamala Harris’s historic bid for the US presidency means for science

The Biden–Harris administration’s signature achievement is the plan to invest more than US$1 trillion in climate and clean-energy technologies over a decade — albeit while overseeing record levels of production of oil and natural gas in the short term. A landmark piece of legislation passed by Congress in 2022, called The Inflation Reduction Act, is a historic investment that seeks to modernize US manufacturing and create jobs in the clean-technology industry. At the same time, the administration has sought to craft and implement plans to insulate regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from political interference.

Harris said on 22 October that her administration will not be a continuation of the Biden presidency. She has said she wants to build an “opportunity economy”. Precisely what that means is yet to be defined — a science- and evidence-based approach needs to be at its core.

That record is in stark contrast to what happened during Trump’s presidency, from 2017 to 2021. As president, Trump not only repeatedly ignored research-informed knowledge, but also undermined national and global science and public-health agencies. He has denied climate science, lied about the federal government’s response to hurricane forecasts and asked scientists to investigate whether disinfectants could be used to treat people with COVID-19.

He pulled the United States out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. He withdrew the country from both the Paris climate agreement and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also called the Iran nuclear deal) — both of which the United States had helped to craft. He instilled fear at the EPA, including by rolling back climate policies and making it harder for its research workforce to be able to function independently of politicians, as many EPA scientists told Nature at the time.

Mounting risks

If anything, Trump’s speech has coarsened. In the past few weeks alone, he has falsely claimed that millions of migrants are “pouring into our country from prisons, jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums” and eating people’s pets, and that members of the Democratic Party support the execution of babies after birth.

Effort to ‘Trump-proof’ US science grows, but will it succeed?

The risks of a second Trump presidency continue to mount. It wouldn’t be easy for a new administration to reverse the investments pledged by the Inflation Reduction Act, but Trump has promised to try. He has said he will ramp up fossil-fuel production and promised to reclassify the positions of tens of thousands of federal employees, including scientists and senior officials in the executive branch of government. That is an alarming development that would require reversing the rule that the Biden administration has crafted to prevent such action. It would undermine a basic premise of modern governance the world over: that scientific and technical specialists working in government are recruited for their expertise, not on the basis of their loyalty to the president or a political party, which is what Trump wants to do.

Political leaders, irrespective of party membership or ideology, generally agree on the need for a society that creates jobs, promotes better health and advances science. But solutions for the world’s mounting problems can come only from a shared, accurate understanding of reality.

A lack of regard for the law and evidence fosters mistrust of scientists and institutions of state. That, in turn, weakens the foundations of democracy, both in the United States and around the world. A second Trump presidency would have an even more destabilizing effect globally, giving the green light to yet more leaders like him.",The world needs a US president who respects evidence  Nature.com,Nature.com,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03417-y
"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"How a Kamala Harris presidency would change health care, from drug pricing to abortion - STAT","WASHINGTON — If Vice President Harris wins the presidency in Tuesday’s elections, in many ways, she’ll work to achieve health care ideas that Democrats couldn’t quite push across the finish line during President Biden’s tenure.

While Democrats achieved major health policy goals on drug pricing in the Inflation Reduction Act, many policies were left on the cutting room floor. The Medicare drug price negotiation program was weaker than progressives imagined, and an effort to add benefits such as home care to Medicare was dropped.

President Biden’s pro-Affordable Care Act stance was a marked turnaround from former President Trump’s attempts to repeal it. Harris has pitched continuing on that track by extending premium subsidies that have lowered monthly payments, and by figuring out some way to cover low-income people in states that haven’t implemented the law’s Medicaid expansion.

Many of her health policy goals are outside of her immediate control. New Medicare benefits to cover home care, drug pricing changes, surprise billing protections, and codifying abortion access would all require cooperation from Congress. Efforts to relieve medical debt could be foiled if state policymakers refuse to play along.

Tackling drug prices

Harris has proposed expanding on Democrats’ 2022 drug pricing reform package.

Her drug pricing policies encompass these main goals: expanding Medicare negotiations, capping insulin costs and pharmacy drug costs for people outside of the Medicare program, and penalizing companies further for hiking prices faster than inflation.

Democrats in their platform propose expanding “the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act.” In practice, there are a couple of ways they could do that.

The most obvious would be to increase the number of drugs that Medicare could negotiate each year.

Another would be speeding up when drugs qualify for the program, from the current threshold of nine or 13 years, depending on the type of drug.

There’s also a chance that Democrats could pursue lower maximum prices for negotiations, said John Barkett, a former Biden White House staffer who is now a managing director at the Berkeley Research Group.

Harris also promised to cap the costs of insulin and pharmacy drug costs “for every American.” Seniors’ drug costs are now capped at $2,000 a year in Medicare prescription plans, while some insulins are available for $35 a month.

Limiting what patients with insurance through their employers pay for prescription drugs at the pharmacy to $2,000 per year would benefit a tiny fraction of people, the available data show. A KFF analysis showed that in 2018, 0.7% of people in employer plans had out-of-pocket retail drug costs higher than $2,000.

“I don’t think it would change a lot in the commercial space,” said Jeromie Ballreich, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins. He said younger people usually are taking fewer expensive medications, and the ones they do take are usually administered in a physician’s office.

If such a policy applied to uninsured patients, it could have a more expansive impact, if patients’ costs could be reliably tracked.

It’s unclear how many people would benefit from Harris’ proposal limiting insulin costs to $35 per month. Some companies that make insulin have already expanded their patient assistance programs to ensure that even insured people can access $35 per month insulin. However, some patients fall through the cracks of assistance programs, and companies could choose to cancel or limit the voluntary programs at any time.

Right now, drugmakers have to pay Medicare a penalty if they raise prices faster than the rate of inflation. Harris proposes making that penalty apply to the commercial market as well, which could further disincentivize drugmakers from taking dramatic price hikes.

Expanding Medicare benefits

One of the Harris campaign’s last-minute proposals was to expand Medicare to cover some home care, vision, and hearing benefits.

During the debate over the Inflation Reduction Act that created the Medicare drug price negotiation, Democrats weighed adding billions of dollars for home care, but the policy was left on the cutting room floor. Harris’ home care plan would provide coverage on a sliding scale for seniors based on income, and support the home care workforce.

Depending on how generous the benefits are and on seniors’ health situations, it’s possible additional home care benefits could help older adults in the Medicare program stay at home longer. According to a study published in 2023, 17% of older adults surveyed had difficulty performing tasks like getting dressed, bathing, eating, or using a toilet.

The policy was targeted to appeal to the adult children who often provide that care for their parents on an unpaid basis, as well. Pew Research data showed 23% of adults are both financially supporting their children and have parents older than age 65.

While many Medicare Advantage plans include at least some vision and hearing coverage already, beneficiaries in traditional Medicare don’t have coverage. In 2019, about one in six Medicare beneficiaries reported that they couldn’t get dental, hearing, or vision services, and that cost was a major barrier.

Strengthening the Affordable Care Act

For people with insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act, Harris wants to extend premium subsidies that Democrats implemented in 2021 after Biden was elected. Those subsidies make premiums cheaper for a broader range of people, and even make some policies free for low-income enrollees.

Whether the subsidies are actually extended will depend in large part on the makeup of Congress, as some Republicans may be skeptical of extending the subsidies. Some prominent GOP health policy experts argue the subsidies have led to increased levels of fraud.

advertisement

The subsidies’ creation has led to massive gains in Affordable Care Act enrollment, and their termination would lead to some people losing health coverage, said Cynthia Cox, the director of the ACA program at KFF. Even if people don’t lose health coverage, the average enrollee could see their monthly premiums double, Cox said.

“People across the income spectrum would see their premiums rise,” Cox said.

Overall, Harris supports the Affordable Care Act and has advocated for preserving it. Democrats in their platform also called for expanding “Medicaid-like” coverage to patients whose states refused to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, though Democrats in Congress have so far not agreed on exactly how to do that.

Canceling medical debt

Harris has proposed working with states to help cancel medical debt, building on similar work during her time as vice president.

Related Story How hospitals could make money off of Kamala Harris’ medical debt relief plan

Harris’ platform doesn’t provide details about how she’d implement nationwide medical debt relief. It states that her administration would “work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to help them avoid accumulating such debt in the future.” During her tenure as vice president, Harris led a push to remove medical debt from patients’ credit reports.

About 8% of all adults carry medical debt, per a KFF analysis of 2021 data. Most state medical debt cancellation programs thus far have focused on low-income patients.

States have taken a variety of tactics to cancel medical debt, from using leftover Covid-19 relief funds to buy discounted debt to leveraging Medicaid funding to incentivize providers to cancel the debt on their own. The disadvantage of working with states is that relief could depend on states’ political dynamics.

Experts have said that measures to prevent patients from falling into debt in the future are essential to ensure that one-time debt cancellation has lasting impacts. North Carolina is an example of a state that attached such requirements to medical debt relief, though its program financially benefited hospitals.

Ending surprise bills for ground ambulances

While Congress banned surprise medical bills during emergency situations in 2020, a big loophole was that ground ambulances were exempt. Harris proposes changing that.

Roughly 85% of all ground ambulance rides are out-of-network, so a ban could provide significantly more protection for people who don’t have much choice about the ambulance they end up in.

An advisory committee formed under the No Surprises Act recommended banning surprise bills for patients for 911 calls and emergency transport between medical facilities, and capping patients’ copays. Insurers would pay out-of-network charges set by local governments, or some amount based on Medicare rates.

Codifying reproductive health rights

Following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the resulting patchwork of state policies on abortion access, Harris has pledged to sign a law codifying abortion access if Congress sends it to her. Strengthening reproductive rights has been a major focus of her campaign.

“I believe in the fundamental freedom of Americans to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government tell them what to do,” Harris said in her Oct. 29 speech in Washington. “I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justices took away from the women of America.”

The problem for Harris is that, Congress probably won’t be able to pass an abortion bill, at least under its current rules. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), has floated the possibility of getting rid of the filibuster for reproductive rights legislation, but with the Senate appearing poised to shift to Republican control, his opinion won’t carry as much weight.

More than 21 million women of reproductive age live in states where abortions are banned after six weeks of pregnancy.

So on reproductive rights, the best Harris could do is largely maintain the status quo. There are some regulatory changes that could help people access contraception — for example, the Biden administration this week proposed new regulations that would force insurers to cover over-the-counter birth control pills without cost-sharing.","How a Kamala Harris presidency would change health care, from drug pricing to abortion  STAT",STAT,https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/04/kamala-harris-election-win-could-bring-health-care-policy-changes/
"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"Watch Kamala Harris deliver concession speech: ""When we lose an election, we accept the results"" - CBS News","Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the election to President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, urging her supporters in a speech delivered from her alma mater not to despair, but to continue ""the fight that fueled this campaign.""

Harris addressed a crowd of supporters, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, from Howard University in Washington, D.C., after she was defeated by Trump in the race for the White House.

""Let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,"" Harris said. ""The outcome of this election was not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.""

The vice president expressed gratitude to her family, President Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and her campaign staff. Mr. Biden watched the remarks from the West Wing, the White House said.

""I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future,"" Harris said. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.""

Harris said the results of the election must be accepted and reiterated that she had spoken with Trump and is committed to a peaceful transfer of power.

""A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,"" she said. ""That principle as much as any other distinguishes democracy from monarchy and tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.""

Harris said the nation does not owe loyalty to a president or party, but to the Constitution, ""our conscience and to our God.""

""My allegiance to all three is why I am here today — to say while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,"" she said.

The vice president pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law and equal justice.

""Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win,"" she said, delivering an appeal directly to her young supporters.

Harris continued, ""Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.""

The vice president's speech came just hours after she called Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the ""importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,"" a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory.

CBS News projected Wednesday that Harris had secured 222 electoral votes, short of the 291 amassed by Trump, her Republican opponent. Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency just after 5:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, after locking up the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

The vice president called Trump to congratulate him on his win and discussed the ""importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,"" a senior aide to Harris said. The vice president, in her role as president of the Senate, will preside over Congress' counting of electoral votes during a joint session on Jan. 6 that will reaffirm Trump's victory.

Steven Cheung, spokesman for the Trump campaign, said that during the call, the president-elect ""acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.""

Mr. Biden also spoke with Harris by phone and congratulated her on a ""historic campaign,"" the White House said. He also talked to Trump and ""expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.""

Harris was expected to address supporters from Howard, the historically Black college where she graduated in 1986, on election night, but never made it to her alma mater as the results came rolling in. Instead, campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond sent the assembled crowd home and said Harris would speak on Wednesday.

Election Day on Nov. 5 capped a chaotic and historic presidential election cycle that saw two assassination attempts against Trump and was roiled by Mr. Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would exit the race following a disastrous debate performance in late June.

Harris swiftly announced her own candidacy for the White House, and Democrats quickly coalesced around her as their pick to take on Trump. Her nomination was solidified at the Democratic National Committee in Chicago in August, where Harris made history as the first woman of color to top a major party ticket.","Watch Kamala Harris deliver concession speech: ""When we lose an election, we accept the results""  CBS News",CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-election-loss-speech-howard-university/
"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"Kamala Harris Was My Best Friend in High School. She Saved My Life, and I Reshaped Hers. - Oprah Mag","courtesy of Wanda Kagan

I met Kamala Harris when we were both about 13 years old. I did not know then that meeting her would change my life. We were students at different schools, but we were headed to the same high school, Westmount High. This was in Montreal, where Kamala, her sister, and her mom had moved in 1976 when Kamala’s mom got a job at a hospital in the city. Kamala and I first met at a Black community cultural event.

The schools we were coming from were both small, with about 200 students, and Westmount was massive by comparison. It was also far more diverse than the schools we were coming from. Kamala and I bonded over our similarities from the start. We were smart, outgoing, and serious students. We were both biracial. And we were both working to fit into a large new school environment.

We didn’t come from schools where how you dressed or what you looked like was very important. Jordache jeans were the big trend, but Kamala and I stuck to more conservative styles. I never even owned jeans, and Kamala mostly wore slacks.

Kamala was always so thoughtful. My family didn’t have much money, and she noticed that I often didn’t bring lunch to school. Without making a big deal out of it, she’d share her own packed lunch with me almost every day. Kamala made these amazing sandwiches—she really knew how to put together a good one with all the right ingredients. She was always generous, but we’d laugh about it because no matter how generous she was with her sandwiches, her Doritos were sacred!

We definitely had our moments of fun, especially with the dance troupe we started. At first, our troupe’s name was Super Six—there were six of us—but then one of the girls dropped out and we called ourselves Midnight Magic. We were all different shades of Black! We would perform at senior centers and other schools’ variety shows, and we even joked that we should have gotten an agent. Our biggest number was a routine to “And the Beat Goes On,” by the Whispers, and we made our own costumes—sequined skirts, glitter-covered leotards, sparkly headbands.

Kamala always stood out, not just in dance but in everything she did. She was grounded, empathetic, and a good listener. Even if you tried, you couldn’t find anyone who had anything bad to say about her. Even all those years ago, I remember Kamala taking a stand for people around her. At the time, if you didn’t have a date, you didn’t go to prom. But Kamala was determined to break that tradition so girls without dates could go, too. We went as a group, and it turned out to be one of the best nights of high school. Kamala even made a bold fashion statement, wearing a hot pink silk pantsuit to prom.

But for all the good times we were having at school, I was secretly struggling. My home life was rough. My stepfather was physically and sexually abusive. I didn’t even realize how bad it really was because when you’re in it, you just think it’s normal. There were many days I was afraid to come home. Things got worse through my high school years, and I started to pull away from my friends, becoming more withdrawn. Kamala was perceptive. She had always been able to tell when something was wrong, but this time, she sensed something deeper.

One day in senior year, she asked me if I was okay, and I finally told her about the abuse. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but Kamala was so supportive. I never expected what happened next. She told me, “You’re coming to live with us.” She called her mom from school, and she arranged for me to come home with them that very day. Just like that, she took me in.

Kamala loved listening to Prince and Donna Summer, and studying with music in the background was a new experience to me.

I’ll never forget what it was like moving into Kamala’s house. Her mother, Shyamala, was so welcoming. At the time, I didn’t realize how accomplished she was. To me, she was just kind, sweet Shyamala. She was so low-key about her achievements that it wasn’t until much later that I found out she was a world-renowned research scientist.

For the rest of that school year, I slept on a futon in Kamala’s room. We walked or took the bus to school together and would study together after school. Kamala loved listening to Prince and Donna Summer, and studying with music in the background was a new experience to me. I cherished the stability of their structured home environment.

Kamala’s younger sister, Maya, was brilliant and driven, just like Kamala. Even though Maya was two years younger, she was always right there with us. I was touched when they let me become part of their bond.

They welcomed me into their family bonding at the dinner table, too. Even though Shyamala was busy with work, she always made sure we got dinner on the table and asked how everyone’s day was. I loved the food. I came from a salt and pepper family, so all those spices in glass jars were fascinating. To this day, I keep my spices organized in glass jars like Shyamala did. She treated me like one of her own, checking in on me, making sure I was keeping up with school. She gave me the support I needed to stay on track and keep dreaming about a future beyond high school.

After Kamala left for Howard University, we lost touch for a while. I was navigating college myself, first at nearby Dawson College and later at Concordia University, where I studied social sciences. I went into healthcare, eventually working at the same hospital where Shyamala did research. I moved around a lot and lost Kamala’s contact information, even though I thought of her regularly.

Then, in 2005, something incredible happened. A friend called me, saying, “Guess who’s on Oprah. Kamala!” I couldn’t believe it. My best friend was on The Oprah Winfrey Show, on an episode about women who could be future leaders. At this point, Kamala was district attorney of San Francisco, and I sent her an email at her office’s website with some old pictures of us, just to prove it was really me. She called me back that night. I couldn’t believe it—it was like no time had passed at all.

When we reconnected, I wanted to tell Kamala that she had changed my life, but she told me that I had changed her life, too.

I told her I was surprised she called back so fast, because she must have a million people calling. I still remember her saying: “Well, you’re not just anyone.”

When we reconnected, I wanted to tell Kamala that she had changed my life, but she told me that I had changed her life, too. She told me that it was because of my situation and what she went through with me that she decided to become a prosecutor, to protect vulnerable women and children from abuse. I was stunned. I had no idea that my story had such an impact on her life.

Since then, we’ve stayed in touch, and I’ve followed her career with immense pride. And now, watching her run for president, I’m in awe. It’s mind-blowing to see that my best friend, the girl I danced with in Midnight Magic, might become the next president of the United States. But at the same time, I’m not surprised. When I think back to our time in high school, it makes perfect sense that she would end up here, fighting for people and protecting the vulnerable.

There’s a special detail I carry with me every day. Twenty-nine years ago, before Kamala and I got back in touch, I gave birth to my daughter, who I named Maya, after Kamala’s sister. Kamala and her sister had been such a huge part of my life during those formative years, and naming my daughter after Maya felt like a way to honor that bond. It’s a reminder of the strength of their family, the stability they gave me, and the impact they’ve had on my life.","Kamala Harris Was My Best Friend in High School.

"Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,‘It’s been a long time coming’: Kamala Harris wants to be the first HBCU president - The 19th*,"We’re going to get you through this election. Sign up for our daily newsletter.

Vice President Kamala Harris not only grew up in San Francisco’s East Bay Area with the divorced mother who raised her but with various play-aunts and uncles too. These fictive kin included her Uncle Sherman, who taught her chess so she would know how to move in the world, and her Aunt Chris, who attended Howard University in the 1950s.

“She was one of my incredible role models growing up, and that was one of the big reasons I wanted to go to Howard University and pledge Alpha Kappa Alpha,” Harris revealed on the Club Shay Shay podcast Monday.

Earlier this month, Harris made it clear that she intends “to be the first HBCU president,” a possibility that has energized community members from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as the Harris-Walz campaign in October toured these academic institutions in battleground states. The HBCU students and faculty mobilizing for Harris hope that her candidacy draws attention to the unique experiences their schools provide. At the same time, they recognize how voter suppression, a gender divide and disinformation may shape this groundbreaking election in the end.

“Vice President Harris understands the importance of speaking directly to HBCU students and alumni about the issues that matter most to them,” Marcus W. Robinson, a Democratic National Committee senior spokesperson, told The 19th in a statement. “Democrats and the Harris-Walz campaign are listening to the voices of Black voters — and specifically young Black voters — who know that the stakes of this election are immensely high.”

Harris is a 1986 graduate of Howard, which is in Washington. D.C., and counts the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall among its distinguished alumni. Nearly four years ago, she was sworn in as vice president with his Bible. Howard opened in 1867, a time when most White colleges excluded students of color.

“HBCUs place an emphasis on growing the student, nurturing the student, helping them to develop the skills to flourish in society and contribute to elevating justice and the human spirit,” said Silas Lee, an adjunct professor in the sociology department of Xavier University of Louisiana, the nation’s only Catholic HBCU. “They focus on the potential that students have and removing that sense of doubt and insecurity that many may have, so that is a critical element that they may not receive at other institutions, because what you have is culturally competent and responsive education at HBCUs.”

Black students who attend HBCUs are more likely to graduate from college than their counterparts at predominantly White institutions (PWIs), according to the White House, which estimates that HBCUs account for 70 percent of Black doctors and 80 percent of Black judges. During Harris’ tenure as vice president, the White House has directed $17 billion in federal funding to HBCUs, more than any other administration.

Howard University senior Christina Pierre-Louis, a political science major from New Jersey, is overjoyed to be casting her first ballot in a presidential election for a fellow Bison, the school’s mascot. She considers Harris to be a kindred spirit.

Born to immigrant parents — an Indian mother and a Jamaican father — Harris studied law and served as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general before becoming a senator and vice president. The 21-year-old shares the vice president’s Caribbean background and interest in the law, with plans to attend law school to become a civil rights attorney.

“Honestly, the big word for me is ‘representation.’ As a young Black woman who is attending her alma mater, who is studying some of the same things she studied, it just solidifies the idea that there’s no limit to what I can achieve,” said Pierre-Louis, the social justice director for Howard’s chapter of the National Council of Negro Women, a nonprofit that has advocated for Black women, families and communities since 1935. Its founding president, Mary McLeod Bethune, established Bethune-Cookman University, an HBCU in Florida.

Elsie L. Scott, director of the Ronald W. Walters Leadership & Public Policy Center at Howard, said that after Harris became the Democratic presidential candidate, student sentiment about the election shifted from indifference to enthusiasm. Women make up over 70 percent of students and they especially “are feeling like this is real empowerment for them,” Scott said. “The major issue where she’s captured their attention has been around abortion rights.”

Harris has made reproductive justice a focal point of her campaign in contrast to former President Donald Trump, who appointed three conservative judges to the Supreme Court, which led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and left abortion rights to the states. During campaign events, Harris has discussed Amber Thurman, a 28-year-old Black woman who left Georgia to obtain the abortion pill but died after experiencing rare complications because her medical care was reportedly delayed under the state’s abortion ban.

Concerned about the stakes of the presidential election, Howard students are taking action. In mid-October, Scott arranged transportation for a busload of them to engage in nonpartisan canvassing in battleground Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Pierre-Louis is organizing an event to raise awareness about voter suppression.

“I’ll have a station with really long lines,” she said. “I’ll have some students come up and give me their Bison ID, and I’ll tell them it’s invalid and have them go to the back of the line.”

In 36 states, the public must present identification to vote, with acceptable forms of ID varying from one state to another. In Georgia, for example, IDs from the state’s public colleges and universities are accepted while those from private institutions are not, a restriction that may be unfamiliar to students.

Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, a national civil rights organization, recommends that voters verify their registration, address and ID before Election Day. College students casting absentee ballots should not wait until November 5 to put them in the mail either because some states require that votes be received by Election Day rather than postmarked by then. The Advancement Project encourages anyone who can early vote in-person to do so to address hiccups ahead of time. Early voting also helps to reduce lines on Election Day.

“Right now, Georgia does have this rule in place that you cannot provide food and water to people standing in line within 150 feet of a polling place,” Browne Dianis said, noting that during the 2020 election, voters queued up for as long as 10 hours. “What we’ve seen again and again is that Black people and students turn out in record numbers, and then what we see is the next year laws and policies are passed to do away with the things that made voting easier and more accessible.”

At Atlanta’s Spelman College, one of the stops on the Harris-Walz campaign’s HBCU tour, the community has invested heavily in educating students about voting, said Cynthia Spence, associate professor of sociology. During the Spelman and Morehouse College homecoming over the weekend, Planned Parenthood Votes Black Campaigns mobilized 40,000 Georgia voters who pledged to back candidates committed to abortion rights.

Harris has overwhelming support at the women’s college.

“They, in fact, every day inhabit these intersectional lives of being Black, being female,” Spence said. “They understand that the world responds to them in particular ways using certain racial tropes, certain gender tropes. They can imagine what Kamala Harris’ experiences have been.”

At nearby Clark Atlanta University, where the campaign also stopped, senior Jayden Williams said the vice president and her running mate give him hope that equality will remain a priority in this country. The 21-year-old from Stockbridge, Georgia, is a 2024 White House HBCU Scholar, a program that recognizes HBCU students for their academic excellence, civic and campus engagement, or entrepreneurial spirit. Williams named reproductive freedom, human rights, gender rights and student loan forgiveness as his top concerns, but the Harris supporter said he’s encountered some young Black men who are backing Trump.

“Can you name the policies that he wants to implement?” Williams has asked them. “Can you name his policies that were instrumental to the success of marginalized communities? What has he done for marginalized communities in your area?”

Usually, he said, they can’t answer.

Twenty-six percent of Black men ages 18-40 said they support Trump, more than double the percentage of Black women (12 percent) who said they would, according to the University of Chicago’s GenForward poll of over 2,300 young adults released October 23. The NAACP, meanwhile, said on a press call Monday that Black men under 50 became less likely to vote for Trump (27-21 percent) and more likely to vote for Harris (51-59 percent) from August to October, according to its polling data in partnership with Hart Research and HIT Strategies.

Pierre-Louis, the Howard student, said that the young Black men she’s met who support Trump have based that decision on disinformation. They question Harris’ loyalty to the Black community after Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — insinuated that she hasn’t identified as Black throughout her life. Others resent the fact that Harris was formerly a prosecutor, even though Trump intends to militarize law enforcement, ramp up executions and put thousands of people back into prison — policies that would directly affect Black men, who are disproportionately incarcerated. In contrast, Harris launched a program to lower recidivism as California’s attorney general.

Some Black Trump supporters tout the former president’s economic policy, Pierre-Louis said. “He gave us a stimulus check,” they’ve told her.

At an Atlanta rally with Harris on Thursday, former President Barack Obama disputed the notion that the public received stimulus checks from Trump after 2020’s coronavirus lockdowns. Trump’s name appeared on the checks, but Congress signed the legislation responsible for the economic impact payments.

“Do not fall for that okey-doke,” Obama told the crowd. “Don’t be bamboozled.”

He reminded the crowd that the public received stimulus checks during his presidency, too. An economic impact payment also went out at the beginning of President Joe Biden’s term, but neither he nor Obama put their names on the checks, which Trump insisted on reportedly.

To boost Black men’s support of her, Harris recently released her Opportunity Agenda for Black Men, which includes initiatives related to housing, healthcare, entrepreneurship and investments in HBCUS.

Beyond ignorance about Trump’s record is how gender factors into this election cycle, Williams said.

“I do think it’s hard for some people to vote for a woman,” he said. “However, we do have to remember that Hillary Clinton did get the popular vote.”

Wesley J. Bellamy, chair of the department of political science and public administration at Virginia State University, which the Harris-Walz campaign’s HBCU tour visited, doubts that young Black men will support Trump in significant numbers.

“I’m the National Public Policy chairman for the 100 Black Men of America,” he said. “We’ve been on a 24-city tour across the country talking to men about voting, and I will say that 85 to 90 percent of Black men across all age groups have stated their emphatic support for Harris. Will you have the 10 to 12, maybe even 14 percent of individuals who say that they’re not? I think so, but I think that’s also on par with what we saw from the Biden campaign a couple of years back.”

Lee, of Xavier University, chalks up the young Black men voting for Trump to a generational divide. They grew up with a Black president in the 21st Century, a period markedly different from the social upheaval that characterized the 1900s — from the Montgomery Bus Boycott of the 1950s to the Los Angeles Uprising of the 1990s.

“There’s a different level of social cohesion that they have with the political and social institutions,” Lee said. “Older Black men . . . have been able to observe and live through the social and political changes of racism and discrimination, whereas the Gen Zers and the millennials — they are experiencing what we call, in sociology, laissez faire racism, whereby America may preach ideals, but it is not honest in fulfilling and eliminating those barriers.”

Harris also has detractors who are not Trumpers but progressive students who disapprove of Biden’s aid to Israel during its war in Gaza. They question why the vice president hasn’t committed to policies to stop civilian casualties.

“This is an issue that students have valid concerns about, and I, too, have those concerns,” said Spence, the Spelman professor. “What we’ve attempted to do is to just talk about how complicated these issues are . . . Kamala Harris cannot wave a magic wand and make it all go away, but certainly we do hope that she will become forceful in her position.”

If Harris unites voters with an array of interests to become the first “HBCU” and woman president, the start of her term will coincide with the National Council of Negro Women’s 90th anniversary year. When that organization began, it was inconceivable that a Black woman could achieve what Harris has.

“It’s been a long time coming,” Pierre-Louis said of a woman president. “I think even if she doesn’t win, just the Democratic nomination in and of itself is enough for our founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, to be proud.”

"Mon, 28 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Harris unveils new Puerto Rico policy plans in Philly campaign swing - Louisana Illuminator,"PHILADELPHIA— Vice President Kamala Harris’ 20th visit to Pennsylvania of the year included a busy day of campaigning across the state’s biggest Democratic stronghold. As she sought to shore up support among her base, Harris also spoke about a new policy proposal focused on Puerto Rico, during a stop at Puerto Rican eatery Freddy and Tony’s Restaurant.

“Philly, we have nine days, nine days to get this done,” Harris said during an afternoon rally at the Alan Horwitz “Sixth Man” Center. A few thousand people gathered at the youth basketball facility in Northwest Philadelphia to hear from Harris, Philadelphia’s first Black woman mayor Cherelle Parker, and state House Speaker Joanna McClinton, the first Black woman to hold that title. “And for the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines.”

Harris, the Democratic Party candidate for president, said that since the beginning, her campaign has been about “building coalitions.” Her visit to Philadelphia on Sunday had a particular emphasis on Black and Latino voters, two demographics key to winning the city, and the state.

Harris described the “opportunity economy” for Puerto Rico she had announced on social media earlier in the day to a gathering at Freddy and Tony’s Restaurant. By Sunday evening, the post had already been shared by prominent Puerto Rican celebrities Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin.

“It’s about giving people access to opportunity, knowing that the people in all communities — in all communities — they want, yes, a job, but they want to be able to build wealth,” she said, according to pool reports. “They want to be able to build intergenerational wealth, home ownership, small business growth, right? So I call it an opportunity economy. The thing I mentioned this morning is I’m going to create basically an opportunity economy Task Force for Puerto Rico.”

She said the task force would be focused on bringing economic opportunities to the Puerto Rican island and address the ongoing problems with the electrical grid in Puerto Rico, per pool reports.

Philadelphia has the second-largest stateside Puerto Rican population among U.S. cities, only trailing New York City, according to the 2020 Census. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies reported that as of 2019, just under 500,000 Puerto Ricans live in Pennsylvania, making it the state with the third largest concentration in the nation.

Harris and Trump have not talked about Puerto Rico at length during previous campaign appearances in Pennsylvania, although some Republicans have used the discussion of Puerto Rico statehood as a campaign issue and as a reason to vote against Democrats.

The Trump campaign has made an effort to win over Latino voters in Pennsylvania, including opening a “Latino Americans for Trump” office in Reading.

Polling throughout this cycle shows that Trump has continued to make gains with Latino voters, although Harris still maintains an advantage.

During a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Sunday, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico that quickly went viral on social media.

“I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Hinchcliffe said. which received a “scattering of claps and jeers,” according to NBC News. The Trump campaign reportedly responded saying that “this joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”

Harris, who arrived in Philadelphia late Saturday, began her Sunday morning attending services at The Church of Christian Compassion in West Philadelphia. There, she talked about the lessons she learned as a little girl at the church where she worshiped in Oakland, California, according to pool reports.

Harris next stopped by nearby barbershop Philly Cuts, for a conversation with young Black men and community leaders. During this appearance, she highlighted the need to recruit and retain more Black men teachers “because we know the benefit to overall society,” according to pool reports. That idea is part of an economic agenda focused on Black men that Harris announced earlier this month.

During the 2020 election, Joe Biden received significant support from Black voters, although the support was stronger among women than men. National exit polling shows that 90% of Black women voted for Biden over then-President Donald Trump, while 79% of Black men voted for Biden. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump gaining ground with Hispanic and Black voters. The Trump campaign has also held multiple events during the year with the intention of winning over Black voters in Philadelphia.

U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat representing Georgia, told reporters in Philadelphia on Oct. 23 that he believed Harris would still win votes from Black men.

“Let me say that the Vice President has always been focused on Black men, as she’s been focused on other parts of our coalition, and I have heard this reporting about Black men jumping on the Trump bandwagon. I do not believe that we will see large swaths of black men voting for Donald Trump,” Warnock told reporters. “I think that part of what is going on is an effort to create a bandwagon with the hopes that people will jump on now.”

Warnock added that Black men are not a monolith, saying there will be some who vote for Trump, but emphasized his belief that Trump’s values “don’t align with ours.”

Leading into Harris’ Sunday events, the Trump campaign described the vice president’s visit as an “eleventh-hour swing” resulting in a “stench of desperation.”

“When Kamala is spending her precious little time rallying Democrat base voters just nine days out from Election Day, you know it’s clear that Pennsylvanians are gearing up to reject another four years of unlimited illegal immigration, rising prices, and worsening crime under Kamala and instead vote for peace, prosperity, and stability under President Donald J. Trump,” said Trump campaign spokesperson Kush Desai.

On Sunday, Harris also made a brief visit to Hakim’s Bookstore and Gift Shop, an African American-themed bookstore with books about Africa, civil rights icons, and slavery on the shelves, per pool reports.

“We’re going to do it. Victory runs through Philly. It runs through Pennsylvania,” Harris said, at the bookstore, according to pool reports.

Parker, the city’s 100th mayor, joined Harris for much of the campaigning on Sunday.

Parker highlighted another key component of the current Democratic coalition: the southeastern section of the commonwealth.

“Guess what the difference was between that 2016 vote and that 2020 vote?” Parker said at the afternoon rally. “More people came out to vote in the city of Philadelphia and our neighboring counties.”

She mentioned Philadelphia’s collar counties by name: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery and said “southeastern Pennsylvania is stronger together.”

McClinton cited recent appearances from Harris in Delaware County for a CNN town hall and a Republicans for Harris event in Bucks County as proof that the campaign recognizes how important the region is.

“It’s very crucial, because we understand that while our state is beautiful and awesome and diverse, and they are working in every place to get out the vote, there is a dense voting population on this side of the state, and as a result, so many times the person who wins in these collar counties is the one who will carry,” McClinton told the Capital-Star.

Ray and Margie Willis, who live in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, saw Harris speak on Sunday at the church service and the rally.

When asked which issues were most important to them in the upcoming election, Ray Willis told the Capital-Star “women’s rights and civil rights,” while Margie Willis added “jobs and housing.”

Ray Willis said he’s optimistic about Harris’ chances, given that he believes “you’re going to have a lot of women turning out.” Polling shows Harris leading among women voters, while Trump has led among men.

During Harris’ rally, she was interrupted by a protester who shouted about Gaza.

“I want to talk about Gaza for a minute,” Harris said in response. “We can and we must seize this opportunity to end this war and bring the hostages home.”

“And I will do everything in my power to meet that end,” she added.

Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes make it the largest swing state on the line this year. Trump was most recently in the state on Saturday for a rally in State College. He’s scheduled to return on Tuesday for a roundtable discussion in the Philadelphia suburbs and a rally in the Lehigh Valley.

Randyll Butler, a Philadelphia Youth Basketball Coach, opened up for Harris on Sunday at the rally. She said the nation needs a “role model for all of us,” and that “we need a most valuable player, an MVP” which was followed by “MVP” chants.

“This is the fourth quarter,” Butler said. “This race is neck and neck. We cannot get tired, we cannot get complacent, we all have to go out and we have to talk to our families and to our friends and sometimes to the other side about what’s at stake.”

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, will host an election night event next Tuesday at her alma mater, Howard University, a university spokesperson confirmed in an email to Inside Higher Ed.

The Harris-Walz campaign will host an event on campus as the votes come in. Classes will be held remotely on Monday and are canceled on Tuesday to encourage student voting, according to The Hilltop, Howard’s student newspaper. The campus will be closed to the public Tuesday.

The historically Black university in Washington, D.C., has been a key part of Harris’s candidacy since she announced she would be replacing President Biden on the ticket in July. Her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has mobilized alumnae members to campaign for her, and she had a debate prep session there in August before her debate against Republican nominee Donald Trump. When she announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2019, she did so from Howard.

Harris’s alma mater has long occupied a special place in her life—and the narrative of her path to the vice presidency. In her memoir she wrote that at Howard, “You didn't have to be confined to the box of another person’s choosing.”

“At Howard,” she wrote, “you could come as you were and leave as the person you aspired to be.""

"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"‘We warned you,’ Arab Americans in Michigan tell Kamala Harris - Al Jazeera English","A shift away from pro-Israel Democrats in communities like Dearborn underscores anger over war in Gaza and Lebanon.

Dearborn, Michigan – When Fox News called Pennsylvania for Donald Trump in the early hours of Wednesday, all but confirming that he would be the next president of the United States, there were a handful of Arab activists left at a watch party in Dearborn, Michigan.

“Genocide is bad politics,” said one attendee at the event, which had Palestinian and Lebanese flags hanging outside its doors.

As the reality of another Trump presidency set off anger and sorrow from many Democratic commentators, at the Dearborn gathering organised by American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), there was a sense of indifference – if not vindication.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had ignored the community’s calls for reconsidering the unconditional US support for Israel. The vice president also continued to assert what she calls “Israel’s right to defend itself” despite the brutal atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon.

Activist Adam Abusalah said part of the reason why Harris lost was her decision to side with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the expense of alienating the Democratic base – Arab and Muslim Americans as well as young people and progressives.

“It’s not our fault. They cannot vilify our community,” Abusalah said.

“We’ve been warning the Democrats for over a year now, and the Democrats continue to downplay what’s going on.”

He added that Harris’s main message to the Arab community was to warn of the dangers of a Trump presidency. This tactic failed to work as voters in the area were laser-focused on the continuing war in the Middle East that affected many of them personally.

Dearborn shift

In the Arab-majority suburb of Dearborn, anger over Israel’s US-backed assault on Gaza and Lebanon was tangible at the ballot box.

Harris lost the city to Trump by more than 2,600 votes. President Joe Biden beat Trump by more than 17,400 votes – a more than 20,000-vote swing that helped the Republican former president reclaim Michigan.

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who centred opposition to the war in her platform, also performed relatively well in the city, growing her party’s support from 207 votes in 2020 to more than 7,600 this year.

Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, noted that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, significantly outperformed Harris in Dearborn, receiving more than 9,600 votes than the vice president.

“The Arab community said we’re anti-genocide. We supported the candidates that supported the community, and we stood against the candidates that stood against the community,” Dabajeh told Al Jazeera.

It is unclear what a Trump presidency will mean for Arab and Muslim Americans and the country at large.

“I hope it’s something good. I hope the country comes together. I hope the Democrats are brought to their senses,” Dabajeh said.

While the former president has a long history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant statements and policies, he has promised to bring “peace” to the region.

Trump also softened his antagonistic tone towards Arabs and Muslims as he courted their communities in Michigan.

He brought Arab and Muslim officials and imams to the stage during his rallies and called them “great people”.

Trump also visited Dearborn and listened first-hand to demands to end the war, which Harris failed to do.

‘It doesn’t stop here’

Ali Alfarjalla, a 32-year-old Iraqi American real estate agent in Dearborn, said that for all his flaws, Trump represents a change from the Biden-Harris administration that has been unflinchingly supporting the Israeli assault on Gaza and Lebanon.

He stressed that the election is not the end of political engagement, saying that the community will press Trump to deliver on his promise of bringing peace to the region.

“It doesn’t stop here,” Alfarjalla told Al Jazeera.

“We have to work more to make sure our issues are heard – to stop the genocide in Gaza, stop the invasion of south Lebanon, and let Palestine have its own state. We’re hopeful about that. That’s our number one priority for this community.”

He also said that Harris supporters’ “lesser of two evils” pitch to the community backfired because many voters could not see a worse evil than the administration providing the bombs that were killing their families and destroying their hometowns.

While both major candidates back Israel, the Harris campaign committed a series of unforced errors that further alienated the community in Michigan and beyond, Arab American advocates told Al Jazeera.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, the Harris campaign rejected demands to allow a speech by a Palestinian speaker.

The Democratic candidate also turned down a request for a meeting by the Uncommitted Movement, which was founded during the Democratic Primary process to pressure Biden over his unconditional support for Israel.

Unlike Trump, Harris did not visit Dearborn, the de-facto seat of Arab American political and financial power, during her campaign.

Instead, Harris met with handpicked Arab and Muslim “leaders” in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, last month.

Moreover, Harris campaigned with Liz Cheney in Michigan and welcomed the endorsement of her father, former President Dick Cheney – an architect of the so-called “War on Terror” that devastated the Middle East.

Numerous Arab American activists invoked Harris’s embrace of the Cheneys when underscoring her apparent disregard for their communities.

“We had Harris endorsed by neoconservatives like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney, and she’s openly campaigning with them and talking about how great they are,” Dearborn councilman Mustapha Hammoud told Al Jazeera on Tuesday night as the results trickled in.

“You know what? I don’t think people are willing to vote for George W Bush, so you weren’t going to see people vote for Harris, either.”

‘I smile and laugh at it’

Speaking under a Harris campaign sign last week, former President Bill Clinton claimed that Hamas “forces” Israel to kill Palestinian civilians and suggested that Zionism pre-dates Islam.

The campaign’s behaviour led some advocates to question whether the Democratic candidate has given up on the Arab community.

“Vice President Harris has shown over and over again that she actually doesn’t want our vote,” Uncommitted Movement leader Layla Elabed told Al Jazeera last week.

Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud also noted that the Harris campaign was hesitant to engage Arab Americans directly.

“They don’t want the heckling to occur. They don’t want to knock on the doors where they think the conversations are going to drag, and the votes might not be there,” the mayor told Al Jazeera before the elections.

On the policy front, Harris did not make any concrete promises to the community – even within the acceptable realm of mainstream politics – like reopening the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, or resuming funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

In contrast, Biden released platforms for Arab and Muslim Americans in 2020, promising domestic and foreign policy moves sought by the community – many of which went unfulfilled.

Bottom line, many Arab Americans say they already survived four years of Trump while many of their relatives in Palestine and Lebanon did not survive the Biden-Harris presidency.

They say they will continue to push for change, no matter who is in power.

Asked about some liberal social media users attacking Arab Americans and blaming them for Harris’s defeat, Alfarjalla said many people in the community have survived war and adversity, so they are not concerned about what others say.

Former Representative Liz Cheney has predicted that millions of Republicans will quietly vote for Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald Trump. Polls continue to show a tight race between Harris and Trump in the final stretch of the campaign, with each candidate shifting gears to mobilize their voter bases as Election Day inches closer.

Harris spent the last few weeks on the campaign trail targeting independent and Republican voters who may have previously supported Trump but no longer feel comfortable doing so over issues including abortion and his unproven election fraud claims after the 2020 race. Cheney, a Republican who represented Wyoming in Congress but has endorsed Harris after breaking with Trump over the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building, made her prediction while campaigning with the Democratic nominee in Michigan Monday.

“I would’ve liked to see the Harris campaign – especially the national campaign – coordinate with us a little bit. Talk to us a little bit. Give us a little bit more resources. Show us some respect. Didn’t happen,” he told NBC10 on Wednesday. “They were just elitist and went out there, did their own thing and didn’t include Democratic city committee or (ward leaders) or committee people. They just didn’t do it.”

Brady said Harris’ short campaign made it all the more important for her to reach out to him and other Philly-area Democrats.

“Don’t you want to go to the people that have a proven record that know how to do this stuff and can help you along with it? Didn’t happen,” he said.

Brady also criticized Harris’ star-studded election eve rally outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art for its road closures and late hour.

“You don’t want to hurt other people going to and from work,” he said.

Brady said previous Democratic nominees Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton all worked hand and hand with him during their presidential campaigns.

“They talked to us. They said, ‘What do we need to do?’ The Harris campaign never talked to us,” Brady said.

With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania was considered one of the most critical swing states in the presidential election. It was ultimately Trump winning Pennsylvania that put him on the path to victory. Votes from heavily Democratic Philadelphia can help Democrats win in statewide races.

While Harris won Philadelphia, as of late Wednesday afternoon she received a total of 547,729 votes, which is lower than Biden’s final total in the city in 2020. Also as of late Wednesday afternoon, voter turnout was at 62.89% in Philadelphia, which is lower than the 2020 turnout as well. Brady’s team believes when all the votes are counted, the total number of voters who participated will be similar to 2020. He also told NBC10 that Philly Democrats worked hard to turn out votes.

“We pulled out the margins,” he said. “We did as much as we can.”

When asked whether Democrats in the city hold responsibility for the turnout, Brady talked about Harris' relatability.

“I don’t think that the Democrats that live in the city related to her,” he said. “And I don’t know why. I don’t know whether there was an elitist factor out there. I don’t know why she didn’t talk to them.”

Brady, a longtime friend of President Biden, also said he was unhappy with how Biden was treated and the circumstances around the switch at the top of the ticket. Biden had announced the decision over the summer following concerns over his health as well as a badly received performance during his debate with Trump.

“For one bad debate? Obama had a bad debate. Fetterman had a horrible debate. And he did public appearances after that and was fine,” Brady said.

Brendan McPhillips, a spokesperson for the Harris’ campaign, responded to Brady’s comments on Wednesday.

“The Pennsylvania for Harris team knocked more than two million doors in the weekend leading up to Election Day, which is two million more doors than Bob Brady’s organization can claim to have knocked during his entire tenure as party chairman,” McPhillips wrote. “No serious person can say they have an answer to what caused nationwide trends in the electorate less than 24 hours after polls closed. If there’s any immediate takeaway from Philadelphia’s turnout this cycle, it is that Chairman Brady’s decades-long practice of fleecing campaigns for money to make up for his own lack of fundraising ability or leadership is a worthless endeavor that no future campaign should ever be forced to entertain again. The thousands of dedicated staff and volunteers on the Harris campaign should be applauded for their efforts in the face of an unprecedented campaign, and will no doubt be the ones who are going to dust themselves off and get back to work.”

"Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Harris distances herself from Biden’s ‘garbage’ comment as Democrats are privately exasperated by the president - CNN,"Washington CNN —

Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden’s comments that seemingly referred to Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage,” setting off a political firestorm a week before Election Day.

Harris told reporters that she “strongly” disagrees with criticizing people based on who they vote for. Asked if she has spoken to the president about his comments, Harris said that Biden called her Tuesday evening but that the president’s comments “didn’t come up.”

“Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not,” Harris said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews.

The vice president also repeated what she has said on the trail, including that she will “represent all Americans” if elected.

“I am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,” Harris said.

The president inadvertently injected himself into the home stretch of the campaign on Tuesday night when he was attempting to criticize Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden over the weekend. Biden mentioned Puerto Rico, which was referred to as a “floating island of garbage” by a comedian at Trump’s event on Sunday night.

“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said during virtual remarks in a Voto Latino get-out-the-vote call meant to help Harris.

“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”

Biden had attempted to explain away his comments on Tuesday night.

“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden posted on X later that evening. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”

When CNN asked for an explanation on the president’s comments, a White House spokesperson insisted that Biden had meant “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” arguing that he had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”

“The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.

Harris’ campaign was quick to try to publicly defend or explain those remarks publicly. But in private, both inside and around the campaign, plenty of Democrats were quietly buzzing with frustration and concern about the president’s remarks.

Senior campaign officials were fielding messages of exasperation from supporters – some of whom suggested that perhaps the president should find a way to disappear from public view altogether in the final six days leading up to Election Day, sources said.

“The Biden gaffe yesterday is just so infuriating,” one former administration official said. “Nobody wants him out there.”

Biden’s remarks have undeniably become an unwelcome distraction. Trump and his allies quickly seized on them to accuse Harris and her campaign, by extension, of looking down on Americans who back the former president.

Democrats are forcefully making the point that Biden is not the presidential nominee, and Harris has been abundantly clear that she has respect for all voters – regardless of whether they support her. They also have lashed out at what they see as a double standard, given Trump’s long history of racist, misogynistic and offensive remarks.

“We won’t lose a single voter because of it,” said one adviser to the campaign, dismissing the significance of Biden’s comments.

As CNN has reported, there had been growing wariness among Harris campaign aides about Biden’s propensity for gaffes, at a moment when the campaign does not want to take any unnecessary political risks. Tuesday night’s “garbage” comments from Biden only ended up confirming those existing concerns for many Democrats.

Earlier on Wednesday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ vice-presidential running mate, said in an interview with CBS News that Biden’s comments a response to the “frustration with Donald Trump’s rhetoric of division,” and rejected the argument that they undercut a central message of the Harris campaign to unify the country.

“I think there’s– the frustration we’ve seen since January 6, the frustration with Donald Trump’s rhetoric of division, it does fire passions, and I think … President Biden was very clear that he’s speaking about the rhetoric we heard at that. So, it doesn’t undermine it,” Walz said.

In an interview with ABC News, Walz said that Harris’ remarks in Washington, DC, on Tuesday should be the message voters focus on, noting that Harris is the candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket, not Biden.

“The president’s clarified his remarks, but let’s be very clear. The vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end. He called this a garbage country, and continues on from ‘the enemy within,’” he said. “What you heard Vice President Harris say, and what I say is, there’s a place for all of us here, and I think that’s the one– she’s running for president, she’s making the message, and she delivered that speech on the Ellipse that showed what we can be as a country.”",Harris distances herself from Biden’s ‘garbage’ comment as Democrats are privately exasperated by the president  CNN,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-garbage-comment/index.html

Four years after Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election and left office in disgrace, the American people returned him to power in the 2024 election.

Major news outlets called most of the major swing states — North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — for Trump late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, giving him an Electoral College majority. Vice President Kamala Harris no longer has a path to victory.

The trend was broader than the swing states; there was a shift toward Trump across the nation, as he significantly improved on his performance in the 2020 election.

Indeed, it looks quite plausible that Trump could end up winning the national popular vote for the first time ever, though that will take some time to determine for sure, as it depends on the exact margin in slow-counting states like California.

Trump’s win will come with a new Republican Senate majority, as Democratic incumbents lost in Ohio and Montana. But as of Wednesday morning it is not yet clear which party will control the House of Representatives, and it could take some time to find out.

What is clear is that Trump won. How did this happen?



The blame game among Democrats will come fast and furious. But though the Harris campaign’s strategy is sure to be second-guessed, the extent and nationwide nature of the shift in Trump’s favor suggest she had an uphill battle all around — because of the widespread unpopularity of President Joe Biden and public disapproval of his record in office.

Harris inherited a tough situation from Biden – and ultimately could not overcome it

When Harris unexpectedly joined the presidential race in July after Biden stepped aside, she faced three formidable obstacles.

The first was a global trend: In the years since the pandemic, incumbent parties have been struggling in wealthy democracies across the world. The reasons for this are debated, though post-reopening inflation is likely a big one. But to win, Harris would have had to defy this trend.

The second was Biden’s unpopularity. The president was historically unpopular long before his disastrous debate with Trump, and poll after poll showed voters irate with his handling of the economy and immigration. Foreign policy, particularly the Israel-Gaza war that divided Democrats’ coalition, was a problem too. And since Harris had served in his administration as vice president, she had to figure out what to do about that.

Typically, such dynamics would seem to point to a “change” election where the incumbent party is booted. In such elections, the opposition can often put the blame for the current state of affairs on the incumbents, make vague promises that they’ll do things differently, and ride to victory.

Yet there was nothing typical about Harris’s opponent: Donald Trump. The fact that he had recently served as president in his own controversial term, with his own controversial record, seemed to present Harris with an opening. Perhaps she could brand herself the change candidate who would deliver a fresh, new approach, breaking from the failed politics of the past.

That brings us to the third obstacle: Harris’s own record. While running for president in 2019, Harris embraced progressive policy positions that Democrats now view as politically toxic, including banning fracking and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing. So she had a choice to make: Should she stand by her old positions and promise bold progressive change, or should she tack to the center?

In the end, Harris took a kind of middle path. She downplayed, disavowed, or simply avoided mention of the policies she’d supported in 2019 — but she didn’t deliberately pick fights with the left in search of centrist cred, like Bill Clinton did in his 1992 presidential campaign. Harris wanted to keep the Democratic coalition happy, pleasing as many people as she could, rather than taking sides in any factional fights.

In addressing Biden’s record, too, Harris tried to strike a balance. She didn’t criticize Biden, throw him under the bus, or break with him — or the Biden-Harris administration’s policies — in any significant way. When pressed about voter anger over inflation and unauthorized immigration, she did not acknowledge error. Rather, she tried to argue that the economy was doing well now, and blamed Trump for not supporting a bipartisan immigration bill. And she did not shift on Israel-Gaza.

Harris’s hope was that she’d done enough to present herself as a new face, and that the fundamental unfitness of Donald Trump — and his unpopular record on issues like abortion and his attempt to steal the 2020 election — would ultimately prove to be decisive to voters disgruntled with both parties.

That hope was in vain.

Ultimately, much of the public was more resentful of inflation under Biden than they were about Trump’s attempted election theft. And so voters turned back to the candidate they kicked out of office just four years ago.

In their only debate on Sept. 10, Americans heard what the candidates had to say about some of the most pressing issues facing the country, including the economy, immigration and abortion access.

Harris, a latecomer to the race after President Biden announced he was dropping out, did not announce many policies during her short campaign, but released some proposals and has her record as vice president.

Here are some key points from the plans she's offered, information about her record and what she has said about some of these subjects. (A similar overview of Trump's positions can be found here.)

Tax plan

Trump and Harris have competing tax plans. Both nominees' plans would have to be passed by Congress, which has the power of the purse. Here's what Harris has proposed so far:

Harris says she'd provide bigger tax benefits for families but would offset the costs by raising corporate taxes, while Trump has said he'd extend the tax cuts enacted in 2017.

Under Harris' tax plan, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, 95% of Americans would see lower taxes, and higher earners would pay more taxes. The top 0.1% — whose annual average income exceeds $14 million — would pay about $167,000 more in taxes.

Harris wants to eliminate federal taxes on tips, which Trump first proposed.

She also says she wants to provide a financial cushion for small businesses with a tenfold increase in the startup expense deduction — lifting it from $5,000 to $50,000. New businesses wouldn't need to claim the deduction in their first year, when many take losses and would not be able to use it. Instead, they'd be able to wait until they're profitable and use the deduction at that time. Businesses would also be able to take part of the deduction in one year and save the rest for future years.

Child tax credit

After Trump's running mate JD Vance of $6,000, although this would be for the

Harris also suggests a return to the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit, up to $3,600 for young children. She hasn't released income eligibility thresholds, but it's likely that it would phase out for those at higher income levels.

Earlier this year, Senate Republicans blocked legislation

Housing shortage

Harris says she'd address the nation's housing shortage with several initiatives. She promises to build 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax breaks to builders who construct homes for first-time home buyers. She's also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the low housing stock.

And she wants to provide Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners.

Inflation

Inflation has cooled nearly to pre-pandemic levels, but prices have risen nearly 21% since the beginning of the pandemic. A recent survey

Harris doubts

She also wants to lower prescription drug costs, which has been a focus for the Biden administration. Last month, the White House announced Medicare reached agreements with drug manufacturers for lower prices for 10 drugs that treat a range of ailments, from heart failure and blood clots to diabetes, resulting in savings for patients of 38% to 79%, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It was Harris who cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the drug negotiating authority.

Immigration



Harris has not yet issued an immigration policy platform. At campaign events, Harris has mostly brought up the bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged GOP lawmakers to reject it. Harris has promised to revive the bill and accused Trump of scuttling it for political reasons.

The legislation would have enacted permanent restrictions on asylum, given the president the power to quickly deport migrants when border crossings soar and boosted the ranks of border agents, deportation officers, immigration judges and asylum adjudicators. It would also have expanded legal immigration, allocating 50,000 new immigrant visas annually for five years.

While the bipartisan border deal did not include a legalization program for undocumented immigrants — a longtime Democratic priority in immigration negotiations — Harris has expressed support for an ""earned"" path to citizenship for this population on the campaign trail.

Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, signaled to CBS News

Harris' campaign has tried to distance her from the more liberal immigration positions she espoused when she was a presidential candidate in 2020. Those prior positions included an openness to decriminalizing the act of crossing the border without authorization and overhauling Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Abortion

Harris and Trump have opposing views on abortion access, an issue that could be a crucial motivator for voters in November.

Both Trump and Harris have highlighted the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade nearly one-third of states

Harris has made abortion rights a focal point of her campaign and lambasted ""Trump abortion bans"" on the trail.

In her speech at the Democratic National Convention accepting the party's presidential nominee, the vice president pledged to sign into law legislation that restores the federal right to abortion — if such a bill is passed by Congress.

IVF

Access to in vitro fertilization services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates.

Harris has repeatedly said she supports the right of women to make their own decisions about their bodies and family-planning, and told the crowd at the DNC that since Roe's reversal, she has heard stories of couples who have had their IVF treatments cut off.

The vice president said in a video shared to social media that Trump ""is literally the architect of this entire crisis,"" and said the Alabama ruling is a ""direct result"" of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe.

Climate



Harris has not outlined her climate policy yet, but she is expected to continue to pursue the goals of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which funded energy and climate projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.

As vice president, Harris advocates moving the country toward a ""clean energy economy"" while not completely backing away from oil and gas, which is a major industry in battleground states like Pennsylvania. The Keystone State is one of the top natural gas producers in the country.

In an interview with CNN, Harris said that as president, she wouldn't ban fracking — a technique for extracting natural gas from shale — a departure from a statement she made in 2019 that she'd support a fracking ban. Citing the creation of 300,000 clean energy jobs during the Biden administration, she told CNN that her experience as vice president shows ""we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.""

A Harris campaign spokesperson said 300,000 clean energy jobs were created under the Biden-Harris administration in both 2021 and 2022.

The Democratic Party platform almost 50% more gas and oil leases during his time in office than Trump did during his first three years in office.

almost 50% more gas and oil leases during his time in office than Trump did during his first three years in office. Trump has vowed to undo what he calls Biden's ""electric vehicle mandate"" on Day One in office. A spokesperson for Harris' campaign told Axios Harris doesn't support an electric vehicle mandate. The Biden administration has not issued a mandate, but it has introduced incentives to encourage Americans to buy EVs and set a target that half of all new vehicle sales be zero emissions by 2030.

Guns

President Biden in 2022 signed

At her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris only made passing reference to gun violence. ""In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" she said. ""The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities and places of worship.""

Education

As a senator, Harris backed a bill that would have provided tuition-free college for most families.

The Democratic Party's platform also calls for free college tuition for all. This is not an idea Harris has been discussing on the campaign trail.

Israel and Gaza



Both Harris and Trump have, at times, been critical of Israel's handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. But neither has threatened to pull support for the ally.

Harris has called vowed

She has pushed for a cease-fire deal that would release the remaining hostages held by Hamas.

She backs a two-state solution.

Ukraine and Russia

Harris pledged in her DNC address that she ""will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris accused

The Biden administration has spearheaded a number of aid packages for Ukraine, including weapons, and worked with allies to sanction Russia for its invasion. Still, the administration's response — especially early on in the war — has been criticized as slow-moving, and more recently, Republican opposition in Congress further slowed aid to Ukraine.

China

Harris has offered few details about how her China policy would differ from Mr. Biden's. In her Democratic National Convention speech, Harris said ""America — not China — wins the competition for the 21st century.""

She told

Harris briefly met Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2022 in Bangkok amid friction between the two countries. The vice president said she stressed the need to ""maintain open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.""

She has condemned China's aggression in the South China Sea, accusing it of ""undermining key elements of the international rules-based order"" and coercing and intimidating its neighbors.

Harris has also reaffirmed U.S. support for Taiwan.

In the Senate, Harris cosponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. Trump signed both into law.

Iran nuclear deal

It's unclear whether Harris would seek to renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. During the 2020 campaign, Harris, who was running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, told the Council on Foreign Relations that she would seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement, ""so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.""",Kamala Harris' policy plans and platform on key issues for the 2024 election  CBS News,CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-platform-policy-positions-2024/
"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,"A to-do list, size matters and a ‘petty tyrant': Key moments from Kamala Harris’ speech - The Associated Press","WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris on Tuesday sought to remind Americans what life was like under Donald Trump and then offered voters a different path forward if they send her to the White House, in a speech billed as her campaign’s closing argument.

“I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me,” she said, speaking before a massive crowd that spilled from the grassy Ellipse near the White House to the Washington Monument.

Some key moments from her half-hour speech:

The location of the speech reinforced her message

Harris chose to speak from the Ellipse on purpose. It’s the same spot in Washington where Republican Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But the vice president didn’t devote much of her speech to the violence of that day, instead using the field between Constitution Avenue and the White House more as a backdrop — a quiet reminder of the different choices Americans face.

“Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other,” she said, adding that he wants back into the White House “not to focus on your problems, but to focus on his.”

What to know about Trump’s second term:

Kamala Harris, the prosecutor, argued her case

Harris spent years working as a prosecutor. She was California’s attorney general before she became a U.S. senator. And she often says on the campaign trail that she’s only ever had one client — the people. In her speech, she talked about her past work taking on scammers, violent offenders who abused women and children, and cartels that trafficked in guns and human beings.

She said she’d bring with her to the White House an instinct to protect.

“There’s something about people being treated unfairly, or overlooked, that just gets to me,” she said.

It’s me, Hi. I’m the presidential nominee. It’s me.

One week before the election, Harris allowed that “I know many of you are still getting to know who I am.”

The Democratic nominee has been running for only three months in a compressed campaign launched after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Harris still is confronting voters who say they want to learn more about her and how she will govern. So she spent some time Tuesday talking about her career, her goals and background.

“I’ll be honest with you: I’m not perfect. I make mistakes. But here’s what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me.”

To-do list for Day One at the White House

Harris devoted a good chunk of her speech to talking about policies she’d enact if she were to win the White House, including helping first-time homeowners with down payments and aiding the so-called “sandwich generation” of adults who are caring for young children and older parents by allowing elder care to be funded by Medicare. She said she’d work to pass a bipartisan border security bill that tanked last year after Trump encouraged congressional Republicans to let it die.

And she said she would work to bring back abortion protections. “I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justice took away from the women of America,” Harris said. The Supreme Court, with three Trump-appointed justices, overturned federal protections of abortion in 2022. Abortion has since become one of the most motivating issues for the Democratic base in the 2024 election.

“On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,” she said. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”

Size matters on the campaign trail — especially to Trump

The Ellipse is a grassy expanse between the White House and the Washington Monument that has long played host to political events and national traditions like the annual holiday tree lighting. On Tuesday, the space was packed. Crowds spilled onto the National Mall back toward the Washington Monument, where giant screens and speakers were set up for people to hear and see from afar.

The cheers of the boisterous crowd could be heard from the White House driveway. Harris’ campaign said it was her biggest rally to date. She’s already packed stadiums and other venues with supporters during her rallies. Harris loves to needle Trump about crowd size — a particular preoccupation for the Republican leader, who claimed the campaign had to bus people in Tuesday to fill the space.

Harris has called Trump ‘unhinged’ and ‘unstable.’ Now she’s adding ‘petty tyrant’

Harris boiled down criticism of Trump into two words: “petty tyrant.”

She warned Trump is a man governed by grievances, one who would focus on himself and his “enemies list” when he got into the White House. She harked back to the nation’s founding when Americans fought for freedom, then sped through decades of hard-fought civil rights battles.

“They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms. They didn’t do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” she said. “These United States of America, we are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators.”

Meanwhile, a Biden complication emerges

Just moments before Harris was to speak, Biden was on a campaign call reacting to a comic who called Puerto Rico garbage during a Trump rally last weekend. The president said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”

He’d joined a national call organized by the advocacy group Voto Latino. Biden urged those on the call to “vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House,” adding, “He’s a true danger to not just Latinos but to all people.”

Biden’s remarks were quicky seized on by Republicans who said he was denigrating Trump supporters, a distraction for Harris when she is trying to reach out to GOP voters.

Biden quickly sent out a social media post seeking to clarify his remarks.

“His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,” Biden said of Trump. “That’s all I meant to say.”

There’s still plenty to come after what Harris called her ‘closing argument’

The event was framed as a campaign finale meant to lay out in stark terms the choice for voters next week. But it’s far from Harris’ last campaign event. She’ll be hitting all the key battleground states as she makes her last pitch to voters.

She will headline events in Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Wednesday, and on Thursday she will have rallies in Arizona and Nevada. More events are expected before Election Day.

The campaign is looking to pick up voters across many different demographics in the hope that a swing vote here and there may add up to a win in a razor’s-edge race with Trump.","A to-do list, size matters and a ‘petty tyrant': Key moments from Kamala Harris’ speech  The Associated Press",The Associated Press,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-key-moments-ellipse-9337554579a61eb271b4f311e3610993

"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Why we support Kamala Harris - United Federation of Teachers,"Every election is important, but one could argue that the general election on Nov. 5 is the single most important election in our lifetime. As union members and public school educators, we have a clear choice: Kamala Harris.

We are also supporting Democratic candidates for the U.S. Congress in Westchester County and Long Island — races that will help determine which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives.

The political conversation in this country is more heated than ever and the prevalent emotion is, sadly, anger. But the union can’t back away from the political arena. Politics is a fundamental part of our work as a union because the UFT is a union of mostly public employees, and government policy shapes our rights and benefits as union members. It also determines funding for our schools.

The UFT endorses candidates in local races, our state affiliate NYSUT endorses candidates for state office, and our national union, the American Federation of Teachers, endorses at the national level. Each of us carefully vets candidates through the lens of what is in the best interest of our profession and who will make our lives better as union members and workers. We make our recommendations based on these criteria, and then you make your final decision in the voting booth.

The AFT has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in this election because she is the champion that we need to fight for public education and protect our rights as workers and union members. Her selection of Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate underscores her commitment to defending students, educators and workers. Governor Walz is a former high school social studies teacher, football coach and union member who has been a longtime friend of labor.

The Republican Party has a platform to destroy public education and undermine unions in this country. Let’s not forget Donald Trump’s first education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and her efforts to undermine public schools at every turn.

A quick look at Kamala Harris’ record shows us what we look for in a candidate. Harris has advocated for increased teacher pay. She supports loan forgiveness for public service workers and prosecuting colleges with predatory loan practices. A fierce opponent of book bans, she wants our students to learn accurate and multidimensional accounts of history. She’s called for gun reform that will reduce gun violence in schools. She’s advocated for increased Title I and Head Start funding. She has enforced and expanded Title IX, the federal law that prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ+ students at school. And, she chaired the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which aims to empower workers to organize and bargain with their employers.

There’s a quote that says, “You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.” This is particularly true in our line of work. That’s why this fall hundreds of UFT members dedicated their Saturdays to go door-knocking in Pennsylvania and volunteered at union phone banks in all five boroughs.

We are educators, and we can use our power to educate and effect change by helping those around us understand the importance of getting to the polls on Nov. 5.",Why we support Kamala Harris  United Federation of Teachers,United Federation of Teachers,https://www.uft.org/news/opinion/presidents-perspective/why-we-support-kamala-harris
"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT",Kemala Harris,Can Liz Cheney help Kamala Harris election campaign? Or will she hurt her? - Al Jazeera English,"Polls suggest some Republican voters are willing to back Harris. But she could also bleed votes because of Cheney.

As United States Vice President Kamala Harris crisscrosses the country – and especially key battleground states – before the November 5 election, an unlikely cheerleader has accompanied her on several occasions: Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman from Wyoming and daughter of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney.

The senior Cheney has long been pilloried by Democrats for his central role in pushing for – and executing – the invasion of Iraq in 2003 on grounds that turned out to be fake. And Liz Cheney has embraced her father’s neoconservative legacy throughout her career.

Yet a shared animus for Donald Trump, the former president and Republican Party nominee for the presidency, has brought Cheney into Harris’s camp. Cheney has been joined by many prominent, old-school Republicans in criticising Trump and endorsing Harris.

But what is in it for Harris? Can Liz Cheney’s enthusiastic support help her win Republican voters in a race poised on a knife’s edge? Or could it end up hurting Harris’s prospects?

How is Cheney supporting Harris?

In recent weeks, Harris and Cheney have jointly held a series of town hall sessions in the vital battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, under the banner “Country over Party”. Harris and Trump are separated by less than one percentage point in each of the three states.

Cheney has been a staunch critic of Trump and supported the former president’s second impeachment after the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.

“I know the most conservative of all conservative principles is being faithful to the Constitution,” Cheney said at a recent rally. “You have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump, who, it’s not just us predicting how he will act. We’ve watched what he did after the last election. We watched what he did on Jan 6.”

In an event in Wisconsin, she said: “I watch how our presidents have operated and even when there have been presidents that we have potentially disagreed with on issues, they’ve respected the Constitution.”

Harris, too, has characterised Trump as someone unfit for the role of president.

“Donald Trump is an unserious man but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious,” stated Harris.

What voters are still up for grabs?

A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted between September 30 and October 15, 74 percent of voters in battleground states have already decided who to vote for. The remaining 26 percent of voters are still undecided.

Seven battleground states – also known as swing states – are expected to determine the outcome of the election. Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, where Harris and Trump are in close contests, collectively account for 93 Electoral College votes – a third of the 270 votes needed to win the 538-strong Electoral College, and thus, the election.

It is the undecided Republican voters that Harris hopes to tap, using Cheney’s help, say analysts.

“If you’re the Democratic Party, you’re still trying to pursue a vote maximisation strategy, and that means expanding your pathways to victory,” Adolphus Belk, professor of political science and African American studies at Winthrop University, told Al Jazeera. “Particularly in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, where there are some Republican voters who supported Trump in 2016, but are now seriously considering voting Democrat.”

The January 6, 2021 Capitol riot by Trump supporters, and the former president’s often confusing positions on the reproductive rights of women – he has claimed credit for the dismantling of the Supreme Court judgement that guaranteed abortion rights but has also suggested he would oppose a national ban on abortion – are among the issues that have left some Republican voters wary of a second Trump term, say analysts.

Could Cheney’s support help Harris win this vote?

There is some evidence that Harris’s strategy of building a bipartisan coalition with anti-Trump Republicans could help her campaign.

According to a recent New York Times-Siena poll, 9 percent of Republican voters nationally said they would vote for Harris. More importantly, a separate Wall Street Journal poll in the second week of October found that in Arizona, where Trump and Harris are tied in a dead heat, 8 percent of Republicans are voting for Harris.

Belk notes that the Harris-Cheney strategy is nothing new for the Democratic Party. It is part of a centrist playbook that emerged from the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) founded in 1985 by several high-ranking Democrats, including then-Governor Bill Clinton. Although the DLC’s last active year was 2011, the methods are the same.

“They (DLC) believe that the pathway forward was to moderate, that you maximise your votes by moving more toward the centre on the very issues that Republicans had used to punish you in presidential elections,” explained Belk.

“I think the Harris-Cheney team-up is about getting certain Republicans, including former members of the Trump administration, to signal to those Republican voters who are contemplating voting for Harris, but are maybe hesitant – to say to those people, for this contest, in this moment, you can make this choice and it’s OK.”

While Trump routed rivals in the Republican primary, there were still significant numbers of GOP voters who backed former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Chris Christie, former governor of New Jersey, Belk noted. These voters were highly educated and typically college graduates who leaned politically moderate.

When the margins between Trump and Harris are as tight as they are – less than 1 percentage point now separates them in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada – a few thousand Republican votes could make all the difference for the vice president.

“They’re going after the Haley voters. And that’s why you go on Fox,” Belk said, referring to Kamala Harris’s interview on Fox News with Bret Baier on October 16. Fox is a favourite among conservative voters.

But could Cheney end up hurting Harris?

For years, the Cheney name has been almost toxic for liberals in the US, associated with the foreign policy debacles of the Bush administration.

This is especially so for Arab American and Muslim voters, whose communities were more directly affected by the war in Iraq and the rising Islamophobia in the US.

Some analysts believe Harris risks alienating these voters – many of whom are already deeply upset with her for the Biden administration’s unflinching support for Israel’s war on Gaza – further by proudly touting her Cheney endorsement.

“There are a number of liberal and progressive Democrats that feel upset about the embrace of Dick and Liz Cheney,” Belk acknowledged.

Normally, he said, this might not be a major problem for Harris. “The way that vote maximisation strategy works is they look at it and think, if you’re a liberal, progressive Democrat, we’re kind of your only game in town,” he said. “If you’re a really conservative Trump Republican, we know you’re not going to come to us, but we can get those people in the middle because there are more of you.”

But this time, sufficient numbers of Arab American and Muslim voters are signalling that for them, Democrats are not the “only game in town” because of Gaza.

Last month, a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) poll showed that in Michigan, home to a large Arab American community and key battleground state, 40 percent of Muslim voters backed the Green Party’s Jill Stein. Donald Trump received 18 percent support with 12 percent of voters backing Harris.

In an Arab News/YouGov poll released at the start of this week, Trump actually leads Harris 45 percent to 43 percent among the key demographic, nationally.

Trump appears to have caught on to this drop in support for Harris among Arab Americans over the war in Gaza.

“Kamala is also in total free fall with the Arab and Muslim population in Michigan. She’s in a free fall,” Trump said on Friday, addressing a rally in Traverse City, Michigan. “She sent their jobs overseas, brought crime to their cities, and tonight in the Middle East, it’s like a tinderbox that’s ready to explode. People are being killed at levels we’ve never seen before.”

He also directly referred to Harris’s alliance with Cheney.

“And why would Muslims support Kamala when she embraces Muslim-hating Liz Cheney?” Trump asked. “Can you believe it? Liz Cheney, a total loser, whose father brought years of war and death to the Middle East. Why would you support somebody if you’re from the Middle East or even associated with the Middle East – why would you be supporting somebody with a Cheney family? [sic] The father killed more Arabs than any human being on earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

The Cheney association could also affect the overall support that Harris receives from Black Americans.

According to Pew Research Center, African Americans account for 20 percent of the Muslim population in the US. A recent New York Times-Siena College national poll reported that 70 percent of Black male voters support Harris, whereas 85 percent of Black men supported Biden in 2020.

In short, Belk said the Harris campaign faces tough choices.

“So it’s aid with one hand [for Gaza] and bombs with the other. The administration did try to put certain pressures on [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but Netanyahu is not yielding to those pressures,” Belk said.

“And that conflict has gone on now for well over a year and has seemingly expanded into other nation-states in the region. So that has been a great problem for this administration.”",Can Liz Cheney help Kamala Harris election campaign? Or will she hurt her?

Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in Iowa — a startling reversal for Democrats and Republicans who have all but written off the state’s presidential contest as a certain Trump victory.

A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows Vice President Harris leading former President Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters just days before a high-stakes election that appears deadlocked in key battleground states.

Election results:Donald Trump cruises to victory in Iowa presidential race over Kamala Harris

The results follow a September Iowa Poll that showed Trump with a 4-point lead over Harris and a June Iowa Poll showing him with an 18-point lead over Democratic President Joe Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee at the time.

“It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. “She has clearly leaped into a leading position.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has abandoned his independent presidential campaign to support Trump but remains on the Iowa ballot, gets 3% of the vote. That’s down from 6% in September and 9% in June.

Fewer than 1% say they would vote for Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver, 1% would vote for someone else, 3% aren’t sure and 2% don’t want to say for whom they already cast a ballot.

The poll of 808 likely Iowa voters, which include those who have already voted as well as those who say they definitely plan to vote, was conducted by Selzer & Co. from Oct. 28-31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

The results come as Trump and Harris have focused their attention almost exclusively on seven battleground states that are expected to shape the outcome of the election. Neither has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries ended, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state.

A victory for Harris would be a surprising development after Iowa has swung aggressively to the right in recent elections, delivering Trump solid victories in 2016 and 2020.

The poll shows that women — particularly those who are older or who are politically independent — are driving the late shift toward Harris.

“Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,” Selzer said.

Independent voters, who had consistently supported Trump in the leadup to this election, now break for Harris. That’s driven by the strength of independent women, who back Harris by a 28-point margin, while independent men support Trump, but by a smaller margin.

Similarly, senior voters who are 65 and older favor Harris. But senior women support her by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 63% to 28%, while senior men favor her by just 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%.

“I like her policies on reproductive health and having women choosing their own health care, and the fact that I think that she will save our democracy and follow the rule of law,” said Linda Marshall, a 79-year-old poll respondent from Cascade who has already cast her absentee ballot for Harris.

The registered Democrat said she identifies as pro-life but doesn’t think anyone should make that choice for somebody else.

“I just believe that if the Republicans can decide what you do with your body, what else are they going to do to limit your choice, for women?” she said.

One aspect where Trump does better than Harris: A greater share of his supporters than hers say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about their pick.

Seventy-six percent of Trump supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about their choice, while another 23% say they are mildly or not that enthusiastic.

For Harris, 71% are extremely or very enthusiastic — down from 80% in September — while 29% are mildly or not that enthusiastic.

The poll shows few likely Iowa voters remain undecided, with 91% saying their minds are made up, compared with 80% in September.

That includes 96% of Harris supporters who are firm in their choice and 95% of Trump supporters.

Independents swing to Kamala Harris, but there’s a gender gap, Iowa Poll shows

In 2020, the Register’s Iowa Poll showed that Biden and Trump were tied among all likely voters in September. But the final poll before Election Day that year showed independents breaking for Trump, and he ultimately won by 8 percentage points over Biden.

This year, independents appear to be turning the other way toward Harris — a move fueled by a growing support among independent women.

Independent likely voters, who have supported Trump in every other Iowa Poll this year, now favor Harris, 46% to 39%.

Now, independent women choose Harris over Trump 57% to 29%. That’s up from September, when independent women gave her just a 5-point lead, 40% to 35%.

Independent men still favor Trump 47% to 37% — numbers that are largely unchanged from September, when independent men supported him 46% to 33%.

Overall, Harris holds a 20-point lead with women, 56% to 36%, similar to where she was in September.

But Trump’s lead with men has shrunk from 27 points in September (59% to 32%) to 14 points today (52% to 38%).

Mya Williams, an 18-year-old college freshman and poll respondent, said she doesn’t identify with either the Democratic or Republican parties. But she’s excited to be part of the effort to elect the country’s first Black female president.

“I like what she stands for and that she's a female and the opposite of what Trump stands for,” Williams said. “She's something new.”

She said she likes Harris’ stance on abortion rights, and she dislikes changes Trump made to overtime rules while he was in office.

Harris holds a small lead with likely Iowa voters who are younger than 35, 46% to 44% over Trump.

Harris’ larger support among likely voters 65 and older, who prefer her 55% to 36%, could be a boon, because older Iowans tend to be more reliable voters and show up at disproportionately higher rates.

The poll shows 62% of Iowans younger than 35 are likely voters, down from 73% in September.

But 93% of seniors say they are likely voters — even higher than the 84% who said so in September.

“If you want a horse to ride on, you want seniors, because they vote,” Selzer said.

Donald Trump holds on to base voters: Evangelicals, rural Iowans, men

Trump continues to lead with his core base of support: men, evangelicals, rural residents and those without a college degree.

He carries Iowa men 52% to 38% and evangelicals 73% to 20%.

Joel Funk, a 26-year-old poll respondent and Garden Grove resident, said he’s excited to cast an early ballot for Trump. The registered Republican said the economy is the biggest issue facing the country right now.

“We’ve lived through four years of him (Trump) being president, and I would say they are four of the best years economically that I have lived through,” he said. “Then we’ve gotten to see four years of the opposition, and we’ve had a lot of inflation and a lot of illegal immigration — a lot of things I would say aren’t the best for America.”

Trump leads with those living in rural areas (55% to 35%) and those living in towns (49% to 40%). But Harris carries those in cities (61% to 33%) and suburbs (59% to 36%).

Among those without a college degree, Trump leads 51% to 39%. And Harris gets those with a college degree, 61% to 31%.

Funk, an automation engineer, dislikes that Harris was nominated without going through the usual primary process.

“They kind of put her in place of Joe Biden after the actual primary polls,” he said. “So, I don’t think she was actually chosen by the people. … And based off of interviews both of them have done, she said she would maintain the same style of policies (as Biden). Which I don’t think have been that great for us.”

Different issues drive Democrats, Republicans

The issues driving Trump supporters are very different than those driving Harris supporters, the Iowa Poll finds.

Trump voters say the issue of inflation and the economy is what they’ve been thinking about most in their decision to support him. Forty-nine percent of his supporters cite it as their most important issue.

Another 25% say immigration is driving their decision.

The top issue for Harris supporters is “the future of democracy,” with 51% citing it as their most important issue. Another 22% say it’s abortion.

“The voting agenda is different for each of those groups of supporters,” Selzer said.

Some former Donald Trump supporters move away from him in 2024

Harris holds on to the support of nearly all Democrats, with 97% saying they will support her and 0% saying they will support Trump.

But she also gets 5% of Republicans who say they will vote for her over Trump. Trump holds 89% of Republicans.

The poll shows a small universe of people who say they previously supported Trump and have now switched their vote to someone else.

Among those not supporting Trump, 16% say there was a time when they supported him, while 81% say they have never supported him. Another 3% are not sure.

Ralph Newbanks, a 63-year-old poll respondent from Solon, said he is a lifelong Republican who plans to vote for Harris this year.

“It's not what I like about her, it's what I dislike about Trump,” he said. “Since 2020 and the Capitol riots, I couldn't vote for Trump if he paid me, not for love nor money.”

He thought about casting a ballot for a third-party candidate, but he didn’t want to lodge a protest vote. He wants to make sure Trump doesn’t return to the White House.

“To me, the biggest part of democracy is the ability to compromise,” he said. “And with Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, there is no compromise, even within their own party.”

Of those not supporting Trump, 67% consider themselves “never Trumpers.” Another 26% say they are not “never Trumpers,” and 8% are not sure.

Among those who say they voted for Trump in 2020, 89% say they will do so again this year, and 4% will vote for Harris.

Among those who say they voted for Biden, 93% say they will now vote for Harris, and 4% will vote for Trump.

Among those who did not vote, Harris leads 47% to 44%.

About the Iowa Poll

The Iowa Poll, conducted Oct. 28-31, 2024, for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 808 Iowans ages 18 or older who say they will definitely vote or have already voted in the 2024 general election for president and other offices.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted 1,038 Iowa adults with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent census data.

Questions based on the sample of 808 Iowa likely voters have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.

Should US Vice President Kamala Harris get elected president this November, African leaders will already have some sense of what to expect, as she would likely follow policies from the current administration. Harris would walk into the office on day one with significant Africa experience having played an important role in supporting the Biden administration’s Africa agenda, served on the intelligence committee in the US Senate, and spent years prosecuting cases with international links.

But Harris has an important opportunity to build on those efforts to advance US-Africa policy. As a candidate for president, Harris has framed her campaign as a “fight for freedom,” suggesting that Harris may pursue a foreign policy that focuses on promoting democratic ideals, institutions, and norms globally. And while she has not detailed a foreign policy agenda, her focus on specific issues—domestically, those include abortion access and LGBTQI+ rights—suggests that she may lean toward an issue-based foreign policy that more forcefully supports human rights and anticorruption efforts, among other issues.

Using the power of the presidency

As a prosecutor and California attorney general, Harris pursued a wide array of cases and legislation with an international connection on issues including corruption, human trafficking, and more. Harris should bolster the US Strategy on Countering Corruption, released in December 2021, which could further empower executive branch agencies to combat corruption in Africa.

In remarks reflecting on her 2023 visit to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia, Harris spoke about the power of partnership with African countries and the significant investment opportunities they offer, such as those in culture, music, and arts. Harris could use the power of the presidency to build on President Joe Biden’s 2022 executive order supporting African culture, creative industries, and digital innovation to strengthen economic growth and prosperity in Africa.

In what would amount to a visible paradigm shift, as president Harris should avoid repeatedly rescheduling visits to Africa, as Biden has done. She has garnered some momentum in showing Africa how much it matters to her with her March 2023 visit to the continent. Nevertheless, if she wins she should strongly consider making a visit to Africa within her first one hundred days (or at least meeting with African presidents in Washington) to show that Africa is not too far down her priority list.

Working with Congress

While US-Africa policy—especially on human rights, good governance, and US national security priorities—has historically been bipartisan, if she becomes president Harris must still make a deliberate effort to work with both Democrats and Republicans to advance critical legislation to her desk. Several US-Africa policy tools would require legislative action during her administration.

The Prosper Africa Initiative, an ongoing initiative started in September 2019 to increase two-way trade and investment between the United States and African countries, should be codified into law to ensure its long-term success in supporting economic growth in Africa. On trade and investment, legislation is required to reauthorize the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in 2025 and the US Export Import Bank in 2026. The potential Harris administration must work with Congress to prioritize efforts to reauthorize and modernize such policies and agencies. For example, the DFC needs the power to make quicker financing decisions and the ability to deploy more robust resources to counter the influence of global competitors, expand partnerships, secure access to critical minerals, and ensure US national economic security objectives in Africa.

Personnel as policy

A successful US-Africa policy will come down to the people who are executing it. If she wins, Harris will need to ensure that she staffs up her National Security Council (NSC) with experts who are committed to showing that Africa is a presidential priority, to informing impactful policies, and to organizing meaningful senior-level visits to the continent and White House meetings with African leaders. Harris and her team should hire creatively for roles at the NSC, looking across the public and private sector to ensure the right people are in the right roles.

For starters, Harris should ensure that the assistant secretary for African affairs at the State Department is one of the United States’ top diplomats and that he or she has the connections and skills needed to lead a dynamic workforce on day one. Beyond that, Harris should spend political capital with Congress to ensure the State Department can do the job asked of it. This includes having the ability to quickly staff historically difficult-to-fill positions across the Africa bureau and embassies, along with reducing reporting burdens for annual reports on issues like human rights and trafficking in persons and deemphasizing the kind of generic reporting and cables that can easily be found in open-source media—as these efforts take time away from more important tasks.

If she becomes president, Harris will need to tackle issues that have proven difficult for US policymakers and African leaders alike, ranging from promoting economic growth, to protecting human rights, to fighting corruption and beyond. To address these issues effectively, she will need a reinvigorated strategy that bolsters and modernizes previous efforts. Harris can’t miss the mark on Africa—after all, Russia and China are closely watching and waiting to exploit any missed opportunities.
